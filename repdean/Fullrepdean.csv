"It was great to join local and state legislators at the inaugural @MontcoPA Legislative Summit.

Been a busy 9 months in Congress passing more than 250 sensible bills -- most shamefully blocked by @senatemajldr.

It's you, @realDonaldTrump. You continue to betray your oath and country in plain sight.
