"We've said for months that #USMCA would be overwhelmingly bipartisan, if Speaker Pelosi would just bring it to the House floor.

The final vote of the year proved us right: 385-41. USMCA will be a huge win for American trade. I only wish we could've voted on it sooner.",1207774309931876352,2019-12-19,21:26:49,repwesterman,4,4,7

"We all agree prescription drug costs are way too high in the U.S. It's time for Congress to work on bipartisan solutions that put people over politics, but H.R. 3 is not that solution.
