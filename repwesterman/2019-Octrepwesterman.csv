"While we're at it, why don't we vote to pass USMCA? Or secure the border? Or lower prescription drug costs? Or fund the government?

Maybe if @SpeakerPelosi spent less time on impeachment inquiries and more time on bipartisan bills, Congress could actually get things done. https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1189105103954989056 …",1189237286107521024,2019-10-29,17:47:18,repwesterman,123,207,583

"So what do we do? Start by recognizing that scientific practices like thinning allow trees to thrive and mitigate fire risk.

As urban areas continue growing larger and closer to forests, we can't deny the issues at stake. Sound forest management must be our future.",1188847938581213185,2019-10-28,16:00:10,repwesterman,2,3,7
"Refusing to manage forests isn't environmentally friendly, it's just bad science. Dead, diseased trees are not only releasing carbon into the air, but they're also posing a greater fire risk.
