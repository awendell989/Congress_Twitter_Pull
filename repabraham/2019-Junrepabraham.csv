"I joined my friend @RepGarretGraves in supporting his amendment to push back against the Democratic Party's assault on offshore drilling.

Desperate people do desperate things. President @realDonaldTrump is holding Iran accountable for being the leading sponsor of terror in the world. Iran wants us to back down on sanctions - sanctions that are working.
