"I spoke to @KALBtv5 last night about the President's new trade deal with China and the Democrats' ongoing impeachment charade. They've been trying to unseat him for three years, but he just keeps on WINNING! pic.twitter.com/jaC7U6HsuI",1217839393379115009,2020-01-16,16:01:52,repabraham,3,11,32

"President @realDonaldTrump has proven he can speak softly & carry a big stick:”To the people & leaders of Iran, we want you to have a great future, one of prosperity at home & harmony with the nations of the world.

"Dems are “upset” because @realDonaldTrump didn’t consult them before attacking a murderous Iranian terrorist.
