I appreciate @realDonaldTrump making the time to visit Monroe next week. The people of Louisiana's 5th District love their President and support him all the way. His visit to northeast Louisiana will be a historic moment this region will never forget. https://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/2019/10/31/donald-trump-planning-trip-monroe-louisiana-governors-race-rally/4110617002/ …,1189959307602939905,2019-10-31,17:36:21,repabraham,30,49,149

I voted with @realDonaldTrump on last night’s Syria resolution because I refuse to join Nancy Pelosi's war against him.
