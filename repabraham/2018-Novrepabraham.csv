"Great visit w/ @CAPNationalCC Maj. Gen. Mark Smith. I'm proud to be a part of the Civil Air Patrol because it gives back to the nation by conducting search and rescue missions, providing youth development with the Cadet Program, and engaging in aerospace education. #LA05 pic.twitter.com/0dy4lXT7yf",1067883016998002690,2018-11-28,20:48:46,repabraham,0,1,12
My bill ensures that the USDA will be able to honor its commitment to have our farmers' backs during these trade negotiations. Congress should do the right thing by these hard-working farmers and pass this bill. #LA05 https://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/2018/11/26/rep-abraham-congress-must-save-soybean-farmers/2116914002/ …,1067144263484493824,2018-11-26,19:53:13,repabraham,3,14,22

My grandson joined me today in Franklinton for the “Wall That Heals” candlelight vigil to honor those who died in the Vietnam War. It’s important to me that he grows up respecting our veterans and that he knows we wouldn’t have the freedoms we enjoy today without them. #LA05 pic.twitter.com/OxeiLmA4sl,1063956882736455680,2018-11-18,00:47:42,repabraham,1,13,65
"Since Louis Farrakhan seems so comfortable chanting ""Death to America,"" I'm offering him a one-way ticket to Tehran where he'll feel more at home.
