Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher sacrificed for his country for nearly 20 years & he deserves to retain both his rank & Trident pin.

"Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump & @USTradeRep, on cracking open another foreign market for U.S. agriculture exports.

"Neither of today's witnesses were on the call. Their testimony is based on hearsay & what they read in the New York Times. No evidence of pressure to investigate & the Ukrainian president confirms it. He never knew of any hold on aid, much less investigated anyone because of it",1194757332489519104,2019-11-13,23:22:00,repabraham,48,150,415
These public hearings do one thing: they show the American people how much of a circus the #SchiffShow really is. He won't even let us hear from the “whistleblower” who claims to have evidence and whose identity Schiff learned 93 days ago! https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/04/schiffs-false-claim-his-committee-had-not-spoken-whistleblower/ …,1194749782679572480,2019-11-13,22:52:00,repabraham,22,32,75
