"I voted to fund the wall bc it is vital to national security to stop illegal immigrants, drugs, human traffickers & terrorists. People have demanded it, Republicans are working w/ President Trump to deliver it. I urge the Senate to vote secure our border & keep government open.",1075921159311552512,2018-12-21,01:09:28,repabraham,24,15,92

"“Democrats feign concern for taxpayers who would pick up the tab, but a glance at the costs of illegal immigration demonstrates that the nation can hardly afford not to build it.” https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/16/editorial-time-to-finish-the-wall/ …",1075438870471176192,2018-12-19,17:13:02,repabraham,2,1,12
Americans have wanted stronger border security and the wall for years now. It’s time for Democrats to acknowledge this and come to the table on a funding agreement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSBXv6kNTR8 …,1075055049951379458,2018-12-18,15:47:52,repabraham,4,6,23

Democrats have steadfastly opposed every effort we’ve tried over the last year to better secure our border & their complete unwillingness to compromise has certainly contributed to this situation. I’m willing to find common ground but I want wall money. https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/article_39c79ddc-ff36-11e8-8cb3-938b9a6e118d.html …,1073677787163172866,2018-12-14,20:35:07,repabraham,14,4,20

Obama’s #WOTUS simply went too far - a puddle that might run into a ditch that then might run into a stream is by no means a navigable waterway & shouldn't be treated as such.
