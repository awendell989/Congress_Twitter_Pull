Every day that passes we allow an outdated agreement to guide trade between our neighbors to the North & South. #USMCA would increase U.S. agriculture and food exports by at least $2.2 billion annually. This trade deal is great for America & American agriculture. #Rally4USMCA pic.twitter.com/CSHOxeJpWa,1172205543995449344,2019-09-12,17:49:14,houseaggop,3,15,34
