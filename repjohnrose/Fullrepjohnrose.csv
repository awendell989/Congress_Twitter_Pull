Jobs in the Upper Cumberland are being lost. Pickett County will be dramatically impacted. Fentress County has already been impacted. This affects not only the Fitzgerald business but their employees and the families of the folks who have lost their jobs.  http://www.ucbjournal.com/rose-meets-with-white-house-on-fitzgerald/ …,1169305015531593729,2019-09-04,17:43:34,repjohnrose,3,0,4,2019-09-04 17:43:34
