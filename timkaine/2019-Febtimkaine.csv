"Trump says Kim Jong Un didn’t know about brutalization of VA student Otto Warmbier. MBS had no knowledge of VA resident Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. Oh, and Putin had nothing to do with 2016 election interference... Why does he keep sticking up for dictators over his own people??",1101169154034421760,2019-02-28,17:15:59,timkaine,990,2850,12033
"President Trump continues to praise Kim Jong Un despite zero evidence of denuclearization from North Korea in the entire year since the last summit. Before he heaps on more, we ought to see something in return. https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1100483396260765696 …",1100524155152277505,2019-02-26,22:32:59,timkaine,128,128,688
"How many more pipe-bombers, terrorists with kill lists, pizza parlor conspirators and Synagogue shooters will there be before this President tones down his rhetoric of hate, violence and lies?",1100489648579792896,2019-02-26,20:15:52,timkaine,171,445,1827
This language from the President is a) a lie (Congress overwhelmingly passed a ban on infanticide 17 years ago that is still on the books) and b) essentially an incitement to violence against Democrats. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-democrats-blocked-gop-abortion-bill_n_5c754abce4b02efbde1ea3b6 …,1100489646621057024,2019-02-26,20:15:52,timkaine,164,776,2015

"With the painful controversies in Virginia, we find ourselves confronting again what it mean that our Commonwealth was the capital of a Confederacy dedicated to white supremacy. To move forward, we must look honestly at our history and today’s injustices. https://pilotonline.com/opinion/columnist/guest/article_d1d07774-362d-11e9-ab59-0fe6e1dae3a0.html …",1099700773968056322,2019-02-24,16:01:10,timkaine,117,156,598
It’s not that complicated. A judge has confirmed what we’ve known for some time—that federal prosecutors under then-Attorney Alex Acosta violated survivors’ rights when giving a serial sexual abuser “the deal of a lifetime.” He never should have been confirmed as Labor Secretary. https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1098944463567814656 …,1099040457714221056,2019-02-22,20:17:18,timkaine,69,671,2605
This week Virginia has the chance to be the 38th and final state needed to ratify the ERA. It’s far past time for us to show women around the world that we stand for their rights—and how fitting that it could be this VA legislature with a record number of women that gets it done!,1098236968574558209,2019-02-20,15:04:32,timkaine,182,1829,7470
Rainy Sunday so made soup for Anne and me. Check this vintage crock pot—at least 35 years old. American technology rocks! pic.twitter.com/X5JQkhp4if,1097301099000807425,2019-02-18,01:05:43,timkaine,532,272,6438
"Thank goodness Europe is committed to diplomacy and peace. US abandonment of Iran deal was idiotic and driven by Trump’s envy of Obama.

"-Removing lead from military housing
-Making overseas bases safer 
-Upgrading hospitals that treat wounded troops

These are the types of projects military construction funding is supposed to pay for when it isn’t stolen to build a wall that won’t make us safer.",1096437822800711681,2019-02-15,15:55:22,timkaine,276,2129,6444
"A year ago this week, 17 families in Parkland experienced the worst day of their lives. We are holding them in our prayers and we also must honor them by taking action—commonsense gun reform can prevent more worst days from becoming reality if we stand up to say enough is enough.",1095373528042520576,2019-02-12,17:26:14,timkaine,131,1286,6774
"Lieutenant Governor Fairfax should resign. The allegations against him detail atrocious crimes, and he can no longer effectively serve the Commonwealth. We cannot ever ignore or tolerate sexual assault.",1094083913104982016,2019-02-09,04:01:46,timkaine,804,1449,8776
One of the many reasons why we need to stop all US support for Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen. https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/middleeast/yemen-lost-us-arms/ …,1092961755699933184,2019-02-06,01:42:43,timkaine,59,129,325
I no longer believe Governor Northam can effectively serve as Governor of Virginia. The events of the past 24 hours have inflicted immense pain and irrevocably broken the trust Virginians must have in their leaders. He should step down and allow the Commonwealth to begin healing.,1091861295865966593,2019-02-03,00:49:53,timkaine,1099,4445,28638
