Military leadership must look at these disturbing statistics and determine what we can do to ensure our troops and their families receive the support they need. We all need to work together to expand access to mental health resources and better identify those in need of help. https://twitter.com/starsandstripes/status/1177448782004465665 …,1177687315193323520,2019-09-27,20:51:50,timkaine,32,68,229
"The people Trump is threatening aren't ""spies"" or ""scum"" or ""animals."" They are patriots. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/26/20885603/trump-ukraine-whistleblower-spy-treason-threat …",1177384500864503808,2019-09-27,00:48:34,timkaine,99,465,2195

The AG shouldn’t do Trump campaign research. The President shouldn’t insist a foreign leader work with his personal attorney to help his campaign. And we shouldn’t condition defense cooperation on whether or not a foreign leader will do a shady personal favor for the President.,1176885110999617536,2019-09-25,15:44:10,timkaine,39,148,606
"Bottom line: The Trump-Zelensky transcript is very damning. 

When President Zelensky asks for US defense assistance to protect against Russia, Trump responds: “I would like you to do us a favor” and asks for help in opening investigations into the Biden family and the DNC.",1176885042624073729,2019-09-25,15:43:54,timkaine,68,179,861
The House had no choice but to initiate a formal impeachment inquiry. The time for stonewalling is over — the public deserves to see the President held accountable for his actions.,1176857935638454272,2019-09-25,13:56:11,timkaine,53,134,905

Our health care system needs to start listening to Black women and providing them with equal care. The Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies (CARE) Act would help address the racial disparities in maternal health. Congress should pass it—now. https://www.theroot.com/a-black-mother-gives-birth-to-baby-in-a-bathtub-after-b-1838230321 …,1175442731289571329,2019-09-21,16:12:40,timkaine,20,80,265
Our kids are leading the way to shape the world they'll grow up in and taking action where their elected leaders won't. I'm so inspired by the young people marching here in D.C. and around the world as a part of today's #ClimateStrike — we would all do well to follow their lead!,1175119349025103872,2019-09-20,18:47:40,timkaine,43,96,573
"Trump tore up a diplomatic deal with Iran that even his own advisors said was working. We need to be de-escalating tensions, not barreling towards an unnecessary war in the Middle East.",1174110115017805825,2019-09-17,23:57:19,timkaine,76,246,893
"If the President starts a war against Iran to protect Saudi Arabia, I will immediately file a motion to force a vote on the Senate floor to end military action.

"Not only was the initial investigation horribly inadequate, we now have even more evidence showing a pattern of sexually demeaning women. We need a full investigation into the credible assault allegations against Justice Kavanaugh—one that's actually designed to unveil the truth.",1173361148155940865,2019-09-15,22:21:12,timkaine,50,204,1097
"Justice Kavanaugh said in front of the Judiciary Committee that his assault on Deborah Ramirez would have been “the talk of campus,"" and now we know it was.

I’m in Arlington this morning where I try to come every year on #September11th to honor those we lost and salute the heroic first responders who risked their lives and health to rescue others.

"First Trump lied when he said Mexico would pay for his wall. Now he’s making military families pay for it instead. We’re going to vote to stop him, and Republicans should join us - if they won’t stand up for military families in their states, what will they stand up for? https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1171390378110590978 …",1171441209274855425,2019-09-10,15:12:03,timkaine,56,143,550

"The Senate is back in session tomorrow, and the first order of business must be taking action on gun violence. We haven't seriously debated gun legislation on the Senate floor in SIX years.

"It’s outrageous that the Trump administration can’t get this right.

"Portsmouth, VA is home to the Navy’s largest industrial facility where ships are built and repaired. One of its buildings badly needs safety upgrades, including fire protections, to keep workers safe.
