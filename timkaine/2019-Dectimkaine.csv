The US conducted airstrikes in Iraq over the objections of the Iraqi government. Now Iraqi protesters broke into the US Embassy. Trump’s malpractice in the region is making us less safe. Time for Congress to stop this foolish rush to war.,1212034179765960704,2019-12-31,15:34:01,timkaine,1058,4139,13579

Senior Saudi officials continue to escape accountability for the state-sponsored murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Trump Administration should be demanding justice for the brutal killing of a journalist and VA resident instead of ignoring the CIA’s assessment of who killed him.,1209166382480281600,2019-12-23,17:38:25,timkaine,98,183,582
