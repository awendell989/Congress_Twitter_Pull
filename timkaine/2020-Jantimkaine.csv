If senators are unwilling to have this debate — because a war vote is hard or opinion polls suggest that their vote might be unpopular — how dare we order our troops to courageously serve and risk all? https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/why-were-introducing-a-resolution-on-war-with-iran/2020/01/14/8a770aa4-36f5-11ea-bb7b-265f4554af6d_story.html …,1217248360916078592,2020-01-15,00:53:19,timkaine,28,201,661

I’m so glad to have @SenatorCollins as a cosponsor of our bipartisan resolution that says no President has the authority to take us to war with Iran without a vote of Congress. https://twitter.com/marianne_levine/status/1217191962836656140 …,1217199999768875008,2020-01-14,21:41:09,timkaine,31,104,475
Grateful for @SenToddYoung's support for our bipartisan resolution preventing further escalation of hostilities with Iran without a vote of Congress.

Thank you @SenMikeLee and @RandPaul — longtime champions of the need for Congress to check Presidents’ warmaking powers — for supporting my resolution to prevent further hostilities with Iran without authorization.

The drafters of the Constitution knew war. They understood that the best check against unnecessary escalation was true deliberation. Congress should reclaim the power to debate and vote on war so we can prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran.,1214944653041995778,2020-01-08,16:19:12,timkaine,70,91,390
