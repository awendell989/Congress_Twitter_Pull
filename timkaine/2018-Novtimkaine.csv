"From excusing Jamal Khashoggi’s murder to aiding this disastrous war in Yemen, the Trump administration is essentially playing the part of Saudi Arabia’s defense lawyer.

That’s not what America’s role in the world should be — and it’s time we all stand up against it. https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1067216696233082883 …",1067905154781978624,2018-11-28,22:16:44,timkaine,42,288,986
"For too long, the US has been involved in a Yemeni civil war that’s killed thousands and forced millions to the brink of famine. And as Trump kowtows to the Saudis, it’s up to Congress to demonstrate America’s moral leadership. We need to end US support for this war now.",1067856145719668736,2018-11-28,19:01:59,timkaine,34,177,784
"More delays and misdirection from this President. He’s said the same thing before, but rejected a bipartisan offer to protect Dreamers and fund billions in border security this spring.

He would rather use these young people as pawns in his game. Some “heart.” https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1067741884796334081 …",1067793134170619904,2018-11-28,14:51:36,timkaine,46,126,362
"Soon to be overheard in elementary schools across America:

An amazing story about how the Trump administration intimidated the 4H program nationwide to weaken its commitment to diversity and inclusion. Shameful! https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/2018/11/18/4-h-transgender-lgbt-iowa-john-paul-chaisson-cardenas-iowa-state-university-civil-rights/1572199002/ …,1066702660911460353,2018-11-25,14:38:27,timkaine,57,546,854

"This is a slap in the face to the American intelligence officers who work daily to protect our country. 

And it’s yet another fawning prostration to a foreign authoritarian. It’s only a matter of time until actions like this by the President directly threaten our security. https://twitter.com/PhilipRucker/status/1064950843680702465 …",1064972499266543617,2018-11-20,20:03:24,timkaine,136,798,3020
"That’s right, this goes beyond President Trump vs. Admiral McRaven. Or Trump vs. McCain. Or Trump vs. the Khans.

It’s evidence of Trump’s open hostility to those who’ve served, and to those who’ve sacrificed more than he can even begin to comprehend. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1064548057277190144 …",1064607876478578688,2018-11-19,19:54:31,timkaine,261,2470,7932

"These sanctions are insufficient. After repeated Saudi lies about what happened to Khashoggi, the Trump administration appears to just be following the Saudi playbook: blame mid-level folks, exonerate those at the top.

This was a state-sponsored murder. We need accountability. https://twitter.com/PostWorld/status/1063097424485314560 …",1063155773654646785,2018-11-15,19:44:23,timkaine,105,520,1663
"Amazon chose Virginia because we have America’s most talented workforce. That didn’t happen by accident. When you focus on investing in job training and education, instead of cutting key priorities and excluding people, your economy gets more dynamic.

"California is on fire and the President is attacking it and threatening to withhold aid. Firefighters there call it “ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning.”

This is a start. Congress needs to stop all US support for war in Yemen and hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/09/politics/us-yemen-houthis-missile/index.html …,1061314039861497856,2018-11-10,17:46:00,timkaine,60,377,1373
"We say “This isn’t normal.”

But for those who survived the shooting in Vegas only to endure another in Thousand Oaks, this IS the new normal. For kids who plan how to respond to a shooter in their classroom, this IS the new normal.
