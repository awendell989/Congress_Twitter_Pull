I am particularly grateful for our men and women in uniform serving our country far from home during the holidays. It was an honor to serve Thanksgiving dinner with my family to some of the sailors stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes. pic.twitter.com/Pe7GzF8ZxK,1200414491353239552,2019-11-29,14:01:32,repschneider,4,7,22
