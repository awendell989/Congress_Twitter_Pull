"We know the Trump campaign shared internal polling data with Russians in 2016. We don’t know who requested that it be shared with them or why. DOJ must give Congress the full, unredacted Mueller report & underlying evidence so we can get these answers. https://tinyurl.com/y62qd8jf ",1154114838194544645,2019-07-24,19:43:14,repzoelofgren,18,33,66
Thanks @Slate for highlighting this key piece of information from my questioning of Former Special Counsel Mueller. The Russians actively worked toward a Trump victory in 2016 and even discussed campaign strategy with Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort. #MuellerHearings pic.twitter.com/niFq6oMqzI,1154066473133981697,2019-07-24,16:31:03,repzoelofgren,7,25,49
"Mueller told me and my @HouseJudiciary colleagues that Russia attacked our democracy in a “systemic and sweeping fashion” to help the Trump campaign, and the campaign welcomed their help. @realDonaldTrump, this interference should ALWAYS be reported to the FBI. #MuellerHearings pic.twitter.com/fIp8eTPqR6",1154060141530112001,2019-07-24,16:05:53,repzoelofgren,53,143,283

The Trump Administration must answer for its unlawful and cruel immigration policies. That’s why I’m holding an oversight hearing today on Border Patrol’s inhumane detainment of migrant families. It’s abusive to children and must be stopped. Watch NOW at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMr45t6oqsg …,1150881980462116866,2019-07-15,21:37:01,repzoelofgren,19,40,133
POTUS is an ignorant bigot trying to delegitimize duly elected Members of Congress based on ethnicity and gender.
