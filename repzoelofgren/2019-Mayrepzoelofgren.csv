Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on Mexico is legally dubious and will likely be challenged in court. It also misses the point. No amount of punitive actions will stop people from fleeing for their lives. This would hurt both of our economies and exacerbate migration to the USA. pic.twitter.com/sp8EdDctG0,1134537836286402560,2019-05-31,19:11:13,repzoelofgren,7,18,41
"Based on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s public statement, it is evident that his investigative team could not exonerate the President from obstruction and that, further, Congress has the responsibility and the right to continue investigating this allegation.

Today marks the 10th year of Tran Huynh Duy Thuc’s wrongful imprisonment by the Vietnamese Government for being critical of its authoritarian policies.

"It's heartbreaking that 6 children have died after being held in US custody at the border. That is unacceptable.

Nearly 9 in 10 Americans support letting #Dreamers stay in this country. This is not a divisive issue. Any proposal that doesn’t protect #DACA recipients from deportation is a non-starter. https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1129016940910043136 …,1129138261623021568,2019-05-16,21:35:14,repzoelofgren,9,19,42

Thank you @GavinNewsom for standing with California’s Cambodian refugee community.

California is bracing for a potentially record-breaking fire season.

I told #CNN it’s unacceptable AG Barr refuses to share the full Mueller Report; abdicating his responsibility to the rule of law. Our Founders demanded checks and balances.
