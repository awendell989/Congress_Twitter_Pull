America’s elections are at the very core of our democracy. We must do all we can to ensure they truly represent the will of the people. Proud to know we’ve taken important steps in protecting our national security with passing the #SAFEAct last week. pic.twitter.com/IhZO9NKFn0,1144961218030866432,2019-06-29,13:30:01,repzoelofgren,545,551,1588
"I’m proud that the House passed my bill, the #SAFEAct, to protect our elections from foreign attacks by updating our vulnerable & outdated voting systems. Now @Senatemajldr McConnell must put Americans first, and politics aside, by passing this important election security bill.",1144348817652953088,2019-06-27,20:56:33,repzoelofgren,39,77,190
"Trump’s chaotic policies have exacerbated the US border situation, causing death and unforgivable conditions for migrants. If the Executive fails, Congress must act.

"If #SCOTUS won’t fight to protect Americans’ votes, I will. Today I am reintroducing my bill that would end partisan gerrymandering by requiring all states to establish independent redistricting commissions to redraw lines that disenfranchise voters. https://cnn.it/2IVu5i9 ",1144282358797033473,2019-06-27,16:32:28,repzoelofgren,20,67,168
"One year ago today, #SCOTUS shamefully upheld the President’s policy of excluding immigrants based on their religion. This #MuslimBan is unconstitutional, un-American, and must be overturned. As a cosponsor of the #NoBanAct, I will keep fighting against bigotry and islamophobia.",1144028019281027072,2019-06-26,23:41:49,repzoelofgren,7,9,33
"Happy to join @SpeakerPelosi & @SenSchumer today to discuss the #SAFEAct, my bill to protect our elections from foreign interference. The Mueller Report declared that Russia targeted election administration officials across the US in 2016.

It is ridiculous—and without basis in law—for the White House to claim that  former Presidential advisors are “completely immune” from answering @HouseJudiciary questions. pic.twitter.com/9reC8kXrhT,1141833370130944000,2019-06-20,22:21:04,repzoelofgren,54,189,487

President Trump’s willingness to accept foreign help for his 2020 campaign is a green light to America’s adversaries to meddle in our elections. It’s wrong and dangerous. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/us/politics/trump-russia-campaign-help.html …,1139261732013203457,2019-06-13,20:02:18,repzoelofgren,24,20,36
Congress can't conduct effective oversight of the Executive without the evidence that underlies the Mueller Report. Thank you @Lawrence for having me on @TheLastWord to discuss DOJ turning it over so @HouseJudiciary can investigate the President with the facts we’re entitled to. pic.twitter.com/17UQ4TvfWY,1138517014530723841,2019-06-11,18:43:03,repzoelofgren,14,19,74
