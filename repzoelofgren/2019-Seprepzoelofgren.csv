.@RealDonaldTrump’s repeated efforts to enlist foreign help in meddling with our country’s elections underscores the urgency for anti-corruption & election security reform. It’s been 200 days since the House passed the #ForThePeopleAct. @SenateMajLdr: Do your job & vote on HR 1.,1177627496835104769,2019-09-27,16:54:09,repzoelofgren,49,231,623
"This lawless approach undermines our ability to conduct meaningful congressional oversight of US refugee policy, which is particularly egregious in light of the global crisis. There are more refugees now than any time since WWII. Trump must abandon his dangerous proposal.",1177592697936404480,2019-09-27,14:35:52,repzoelofgren,6,9,33
"Late last night, Trump again ignored the law by quietly issuing historically low US refugee admissions numbers for 2020 without even consulting Congress, which is required by statute. This is an affront to our nation’s values. https://www.newsweek.com/trump-administration-condemned-slashing-refugee-settlement-admissions-historic-low-1461768 …",1177592695637843968,2019-09-27,14:35:51,repzoelofgren,6,35,76
"If a 19-year-old from Gilroy can cross state lines into Nevada to buy a weapon of war banned in his home state & kill children, California's gun laws alone aren’t sufficient. We must reauthorize the federal #AssaultWeaponsBan to protect all of our communities from gun violence. pic.twitter.com/96LYjlG8b5",1176977540973547520,2019-09-25,21:51:27,repzoelofgren,12,22,123
"After the #GilroyShooting, family-friendly events planned for the weekend were cancelled. People were afraid to leave their homes. Gun violence harms entire communities.

A formal impeachment inquiry should be undertaken in the House of Representatives. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/noYa3oKOOT,1176607837977489414,2019-09-24,21:22:23,repzoelofgren,42,81,348
"Today @RepBera & I led @HouseJudiciary & @HouseForeign committees’ first ever joint hearing on Trump’s #MuslimBan.

I’m deeply troubled by reports of detentions without due process and communications blockades in Kashmir. The US must speak out against this human rights crisis. India can and must do better to ensure that freedoms for all its citizens are upheld. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-kashmir/restore-normal-life-to-kashmir-indias-top-court-tells-government-idUSKBN1W115P …,1174824834355859457,2019-09-19,23:17:22,repzoelofgren,42,29,65
"Today I demanded that EPA Administrator Wheeler answer for the Administration’s unprecedented attack on the Clean Air Act. By threatening auto-makers reaching a vehicle emissions agreement with CA, Trump has thrown our state’s clean air policies & the auto industry into chaos. pic.twitter.com/Scfn0aZrWQ",1174800502640533504,2019-09-19,21:40:41,repzoelofgren,20,42,131
This is another politically motivated attack on California for pioneering strong environmental policies. Revoking our right to set tougher auto emission standards is a blow to public health and the will of California voters. https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2019-09-17/trump-revokes-california-environmental-authority-auto-deal …,1174457198417784833,2019-09-18,22:56:31,repzoelofgren,8,10,55
"High-capacity magazines are banned in CA, but the #GilroyShooting perpetrator still bought them by crossing state lines. Three people would still be alive today if they were banned nationally. @HouseJudiciaryDems & I passed @RepTedDeutch's #KeepAmericansSafe Act to do just that. pic.twitter.com/P5bsOzQWQl",1172283748877910023,2019-09-12,23:00:00,repzoelofgren,13,29,63
State gun safety laws alone can’t prevent all mass shootings. The #GilroyShooting perpetrator avoided CA gun laws by buying his weapon in Nevada. Proud to support @RepCarbajal & @RepLucyMcBath in their efforts to extend effective state gun laws to the federal level. pic.twitter.com/jt47M0mkvW,1171565351890538507,2019-09-10,23:25:21,repzoelofgren,29,93,276
My colleagues & I on the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force just held a forum with @SpeakerPelosi & Chairman @RepThompson demanding the Senate act on gun safety bills passed by the House.

The Trump administration has failed to effectively manage the humanitarian crisis at the border as it continues to mistreat families and put them in danger. I will continue to fight in Congress to hold this Administration accountable for its destructive immigration policies.,1171496088756346888,2019-09-10,18:50:07,repzoelofgren,6,5,17
"The President’s “Remain in Mexico” policy forces vulnerable families to stay in dangerous conditions similar to those they fled, all while they are funneled into a chaotic system that can make them miss their asylum hearing through no fault of their own. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-courts-insight/hasty-rollout-of-trump-immigration-policy-has-broken-border-courts-idUSKCN1VV115 …",1171496087481249794,2019-09-10,18:50:07,repzoelofgren,3,8,14
