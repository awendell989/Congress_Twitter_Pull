The VA’s announcement that it will ignore federal law and cheat veterans out of their GI benefits is insulting and unacceptable. The Trump Administration’s leadership of the VA has been characterized by gross negligence and severe failures in oversight. pic.twitter.com/szfYYzW2xB,1068244457487810563,2018-11-29,20:45:00,rephastingsfl,5,6,11

Today’s guilty plea from President Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen makes it clear that the President repeatedly lied about his business interests in Russia and that his associates were willing to lie and deceive Congress to cover it up.,1068235347329511424,2018-11-29,20:08:48,rephastingsfl,2,3,13

@POTUS' discriminatory ban on transgender individuals bravely serving in our military would weaken our national security & country. Diversity is a strength. Democrats won't let these prejudiced policies arbitrarily single-out transgender individuals who've felt the call to serve.,1067164563991396352,2018-11-26,21:13:53,rephastingsfl,5,0,0

"President Trump’s attempt to bury his own administration’s National Climate Assessment is as shameful as the report is shocking: higher temps, rising sea levels, deadly wildfires, and more category 5 hurricanes affect us all, but minority and low-income communities suffer most.",1067099111671906305,2018-11-26,16:53:48,rephastingsfl,5,5,15

"Please remember the 5,500+ service members deployed to the border as props of the @RealDonaldTrump Admin. They are in tents with virtually no electricity. They are away from their families.

Republican leaders have advocated for purposefully not counting the votes of FL servicemembers deployed overseas & voting absentee.

Gov. Rick Scott’s attempts to block votes from being counted in South Florida is the height of absurdity. There is zero evidence of fraud. The canvassing board is working diligently to count every vote – as it should. #CountEveryVote,1060987373700501504,2018-11-09,20:07:56,rephastingsfl,34,159,450

@POTUS continues to obfuscate the truth but he is not fooling anyone. He was wrong to revoke @Acosta’s WH credentials. The video of the exchange speaks for itself.
