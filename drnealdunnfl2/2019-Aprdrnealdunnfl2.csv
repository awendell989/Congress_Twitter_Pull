"It was great to see @CityofPanamaCty Mayor Brudnicki, City Manager McQueen & @BDS_Supt up in DC today fighting for disaster relief.

"If my Democrat colleagues are serious about pursuing wrongdoing, I would encourage them to look here. The American people have lost trust in the Justice Department and AG Barr is taking meaningful steps to ensure that it is restored.",1118965497708589056,2019-04-18,19:52:18,drnealdunnfl2,7,1,8
Throughout this investigation there have been clear ethical violations that have put our national security at risk. AG Barr has stepped up during his short time as the head of the Justice Department and launched extensive investigations into the practices of the DOJ and the FBI.,1118965496056033280,2019-04-18,19:52:18,drnealdunnfl2,5,1,6
AG Barr also confirmed the Special Counsel had full cooperation of the White House throughout his investigation. Unfortunately Dems will never be happy w/ the truth & they have made it clear that they will continue to waste time & resources until they create the result they want.,1118965494718050304,2019-04-18,19:52:17,drnealdunnfl2,1,1,3
The House voted unanimously to release the report & that is exactly what the AG has done. By working directly w/ Special Counsel on necessary redactions I believe he has more than fulfilled his promise & it is time for Dems in Congress to end their witch hunt & get back to work.,1118965493229129728,2019-04-18,19:52:17,drnealdunnfl2,1,0,3
I commend Attorney General Barr for his timely release of the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and for his commitment to transparency for the American people. I look forward to reviewing the report over the coming days.,1118965491207409665,2019-04-18,19:52:17,drnealdunnfl2,4,9,19

We are almost 100 days into the Democrat led House and we still have no disaster relief.
