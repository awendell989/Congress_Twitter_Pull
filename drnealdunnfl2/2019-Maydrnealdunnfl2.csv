"On this Memorial Day, I ask you to find a way to give of yourself, to remember those who gave their lives so that others might live. That way, they can never be forgotten. Thank you. 3/3",1133066854153502720,2019-05-27,17:46:04,drnealdunnfl2,3,1,7
"“Their lives remind us that freedom is not bought cheaply,” President Reagan said. “It has a cost; it imposes a burden. And just as they whom we commemorate were willing to sacrifice, so too must we -- in a less final, less heroic way -- be willing to give of ourselves.” 2/3",1133066852303818754,2019-05-27,17:46:03,drnealdunnfl2,3,1,7

Congress has a duty to the American people to ensure the federal government can function properly. It is time to correct course and do the right thing for the people of the United States that have waited far too long for our help.,1131624708745650176,2019-05-23,18:15:29,drnealdunnfl2,4,1,11
".@SpeakerPelosi and .@SenSchumer have once again moved the goal post on getting disaster relief to Americans across the country. Today, I urged them to come down to the Panhandle and see the devastation for themselves. #HurricaneMichael #sayfie https://dunn.house.gov/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=F75CC142-DCE2-4D0C-8EBA-8C398D483BB9 …",1131624707663552515,2019-05-23,18:15:29,drnealdunnfl2,17,19,27

"100 years ago today the House  passed the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, guaranteeing women the right to vote.

The American Farm Bureau Federation works hard to represent farmers across this country and ensure that their voices are heard in Washington. I am honored to receive the Friend of Farm Bureau award for my work on the House Agriculture Committee fighting for Florida farmers. pic.twitter.com/VxyGRDFWrV,1129118740375851008,2019-05-16,20:17:40,drnealdunnfl2,2,2,13
I had a great time meeting w/ FL reps from @ACPinternists. We discussed high prescription drug prices & lack of access to affordable health care coverage. I always encourage physicians to get engaged & advocate for their patients & that is exactly what these doctors are doing. pic.twitter.com/PUTUs7aubQ,1128765189162184707,2019-05-15,20:52:47,drnealdunnfl2,6,3,10

I urge the Senate to immediately take up a disaster supplemental and work with the president to provide much needed relief to those in need. https://dunn.house.gov/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=9ACB9632-438D-4353-9F04-CA0B1C532616 …,1126973231423008776,2019-05-10,22:12:11,drnealdunnfl2,2,13,15
It is our duty to help our fellow Americans in need. This disaster relief bill also included my amendments to increase funding to our armed services. Our military readiness is in crisis and will continue to be if we do not provide the necessary resources to our armed services.,1126973230013648896,2019-05-10,22:12:10,drnealdunnfl2,2,14,11
"While less than we worked for, this disaster supplemental is a step in the right direction.
