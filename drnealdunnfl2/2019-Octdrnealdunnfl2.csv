The reason they haven’t presented any evidence is that they have none. This ‘Soviet style justice’ is an insult to our democracy. This investigation would not stand up in any court in the United States and should not stand up in the House of Representatives. #ImpeachmentVote,1189946483698806784,2019-10-31,16:45:24,drnealdunnfl2,11,8,19
"This vote is more political theatre, as Nancy Pelosi & House Democrats try to backtrack and validate the tainted process of their partisan witch hunt against President Trump. Their goal has been impeachment since November 9, 2016. They want to undo the election. #ImpeachmentVote",1189946482989907979,2019-10-31,16:45:24,drnealdunnfl2,21,11,26
This is a big win for America and for all those fighting terrorism. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was one of the worst terrorists in the world. His death sends a message that the United States will continue to fight until all ISIS terrorists are brought to justice. https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/10/27/trump-announces-isis-leader-al-baghdadi-killed-syria-sot-sotu-vpx.cnn …,1189164309672316928,2019-10-29,12:57:19,drnealdunnfl2,11,5,15

This impeachment inquiry is a sham. Adam Schiff has refused to release to the public the transcripts & even refuses to let members of Congress into the hearings. Their goal has been impeachment since the 2016 election & they will use any means to get there. #StopTheSchiffShow pic.twitter.com/VX2a4KUQmc,1186998170926174208,2019-10-23,13:29:51,drnealdunnfl2,44,60,101

"It’s unconscionable that Speaker Pelosi is arbitrarily choosing to impeach the President w/o holding a single vote to do so. It’s un-American and flies in the face of the Constitution.
