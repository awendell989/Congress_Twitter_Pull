"Recently, I honored the life of Mexico Beach City Manager Andy Anderson. Just months ago, Mr. Anderson & I met to discuss the rebuild of Mexico Beach following Hurricane Michael. He was dedicated & reflected the resiliency of Mexico Beach. It was an honor to know & work with him. pic.twitter.com/q1WKky2t7g",1211659089798934528,2019-12-30,14:43:33,drnealdunnfl2,2,3,13

"This week, I honored the life of James Montgomery on the House floor. Mr. Mont will be my missed by his entire community, but his legacy and the impact he has made will never be forgotten. pic.twitter.com/i4j1duPvc4",1208037668975730688,2019-12-20,14:53:19,drnealdunnfl2,1,2,4
Heading to the House floor to vote against both articles of impeachment. pic.twitter.com/hnP6qWlLrX,1207468082119229440,2019-12-19,01:09:59,drnealdunnfl2,142,169,817
We were told this investigation was going to be bipartisan and transparent. Instead these proceedings were held in secret behind closed doors with no attempt at a fair hearing. All this was done deliberately in an effort to undo the results of the 2016 election. pic.twitter.com/MjDshkoddy,1207420755350302726,2019-12-18,22:01:55,drnealdunnfl2,22,18,34
The shameful vote today to impeach @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  will be a lasting stain on the House.,1207334891031015425,2019-12-18,16:20:43,drnealdunnfl2,194,213,742
"We still have a lot of rebuilding to do in the Panhandle, but the passage of this tax relief is an important part of the process.",1207036784670052352,2019-12-17,20:36:09,drnealdunnfl2,1,0,0
This important legislation allows disaster victims to access money they have saved over the years without facing penalties and temporarily suspends limitations on charitable contributions to our area that are associated with hurricane relief.,1207036783558643714,2019-12-17,20:36:09,drnealdunnfl2,1,1,2
The passage of these crucial tax extenders is a big win for Hurricane Michael victims who are still picking up the pieces more than a year later. We finally got routine disaster tax relief across the finish line. https://dunn.house.gov/press-releases?id=C6FD1B7B-F5CF-4C21-B0AC-CE4B7C53E7F6 …,1207036782266789890,2019-12-17,20:36:09,drnealdunnfl2,3,2,7
I trust that the Supreme Court will stand by their previous acknowledgment and ensure Florida gets its fair share of water.,1205317400549363712,2019-12-13,02:43:56,drnealdunnfl2,5,0,5
"Last year, the Supreme Court recognized that Florida has been harmed as a result of decreased water flow to the ACF River Basin. They established that Georgia’s unchecked and excessive water usage has harmed Florida and cost us jobs, particularly in our oyster industry.",1205317399496577024,2019-12-13,02:43:56,drnealdunnfl2,2,0,2
Judge Kelly’s recommendation is very disappointing and completely ignores the decades of damage that Georgia’s water use has had on families and the ecosystem in Florida. https://apnews.com/e666b246a5bdc5e059a280190efbdb80 …,1205317398146027520,2019-12-13,02:43:56,drnealdunnfl2,2,3,3
Just joined several of my colleagues in the House in a moment of silence to honor the lives lost in the terrible attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola last week. We continue to pray for the families and friends of the three sailors who were tragically killed. pic.twitter.com/weDALjAUmX,1205205268906348544,2019-12-12,19:18:22,drnealdunnfl2,11,11,115
Our men and women in uniform repeatedly suffer the consequences of a divided Congress and are forced to keep us safe with outdated equipment and technology. This important legislation works to reverse years of underfunding.,1204928919364870150,2019-12-12,01:00:15,drnealdunnfl2,1,1,1
It also gives certainty to the Panhandle that Tyndall Air Force Base will be fully rebuilt and includes my legislation requiring the Secretary of Defense to provide a report to Congress on the future of Artificial Intelligence in DoD.,1204928918408646656,2019-12-12,01:00:15,drnealdunnfl2,2,2,1

It was an honor to join the @RedCross today & send holiday cards to our service members. Many in our military miss spending the holidays with loved ones because they are fighting for our freedoms at home & abroad.
