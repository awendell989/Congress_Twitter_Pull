"Has Nancy Pelosi talked with Mexican President about his plan to send troops and erect barriers to secure Mexico’s southern border?

Because I don’t think he understands what she means when she says these proven tools don’t work.

Neither does anybody else!",1144404622846697473,2019-06-28,00:38:18,desjarlaistn04,4,4,10
"Well, Democrats, you put on a good show. You denied there was a border crisis when it was clear to every American.

You even protested bed for kids. And when Republicans pointed out CBP, ICE and HHS were strained to capacity, you pretended funding was your idea all along.
