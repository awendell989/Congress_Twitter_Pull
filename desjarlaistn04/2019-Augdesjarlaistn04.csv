"Throughout investigation, James Comey has claimed criticism is an attack on all FBI agents. Liberal media repeated this nonsense. Today's IG report documents many colleagues' surprise, shock and disappointment that Comey would leak classified info and lie to FBI about it.",1167141778618769409,2019-08-29,18:27:39,desjarlaistn04,11,2,7
"Today's IG report shows James Comey stole documents, leaked classified info, violated FBI policy. This is 2nd investigation into his mismanagement. Another another one coming.

One of China’s many broken promises during trade negotiations — stopping flood of fentanyl from Chinese manufacturers. Nothing happens w/out Communist regime’s say-so. They’re working with cartels to poison Americans. It’s a public health crisis. It’s an assault on the U.S.,1165634691204100097,2019-08-25,14:39:01,desjarlaistn04,5,6,9

"China only hurting itself by refusing to negotiate. US economy is strong, China’s not. Its economy almost entirely dependent on cheap labor and US imports. Manufacturing is returning to the US, more companies moving out of China. 
Trade trickery all the communists have left!",1165003407767330816,2019-08-23,20:50:31,desjarlaistn04,8,5,20
"China cheats US farmers. Steals our technology.

The communist dictatorship imprisons and tortures dissidents. 

The world’s worst polluter manufactures fentanyl killing Americans.
