"One in five households receiving food stamps had more than $100k in assets... Tens of thousands with more than $1 million in assets. 

We tried to stop abuse, but Democrats refuse any reform. They say we’re depriving millionaires of food stamps! Trump Admin is addressing problem.",1155190789485539329,2019-07-27,18:58:41,desjarlaistn04,5174,1698,2639

"""Surplus""

Today, it's a foreign concept, but in great economies like this one, the government should generate budget surpluses for a rainy day, even at lower tax rates.

The trick is not over-spending, which is what today's budget deal does. I voted no to deficits and debt.",1154505192861130752,2019-07-25,21:34:22,desjarlaistn04,30,5,26

Last week we had impeachment vote that fizzled. This week we had Mueller hearings that went kerplunk. Amazing to think these are two main Democrat priorities for that last couple years or more. Even media buddies are ignoring or panning the efforts. Now that’s saying something.,1154191619513638912,2019-07-25,00:48:20,desjarlaistn04,29,9,48
"House passed a bill doubling minimum wage. Big increase would eliminate many jobs and harm small family businesses. 

However, there's plenty of evidence illegal immigration harms low-wage workers the most. If Democrats really cared, they'd help us end unfair labor competition.",1151909338145009665,2019-07-18,17:39:22,desjarlaistn04,11,11,29
"More than 2 years of impeachment hysteria ended with an embarrassing vote for Democrats yesterday that liberal media, which has fueled the frenzy, largely ignored. No surprises there.

"Total chaos on the House Floor last night. The far-left has taken over. Agenda continues to be removing President from office, same as it ever was since the 2016 election.

"This is like the ""guaranteed income"" illusion. Democrats propose raising your taxes to guarantee a small amount in return. Some deal.
