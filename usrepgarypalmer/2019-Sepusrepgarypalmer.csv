"I plan to stand with the Constitution in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. This is not about high crimes & misdemeanors, but politics.

This is another preposterous technique aimed at impeachment from a committee that should be focusing on infrastructure, as its name suggests. @TransportGOP #ImaginaryImpeachment",1176901257132421120,2019-09-25,16:48:20,usrepgarypalmer,9,7,13
