"From the beginning of this #ShamImpeachment process against POTUS, there has been no evidence of treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors. For that reason, I will vote ""NO"" on both articles of impeachment.

"Last night, I voted no on the 2 ""minibus"" bills that authorized continued gov funding.

"Great to be in Montgomery on Sat. to celebrate Alabama's 200th b’day & the dedication of AL Bicentennial Park. It has 16 bronze relief plaques to tell the state's history, good & bad. It’s a reminder of how far we’ve come & how far we need to go as we begin our 3rd century #AL200 pic.twitter.com/snFstWdcfP",1207048902349926400,2019-12-17,21:24:18,usrepgarypalmer,9,1,8
Thanks to Don Dailey for having me on @CapitolJournal Journal this weekend. We discussed my deep concerns about the impeachment process against President Trump and the possible precedent it could be setting for the future of the country.

"I'm supporting the Lower Costs, More Cures Act for Gabe in my district, & for others like him who battle rare diseases. Gabe has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an unusual condition with no cure.

"None of this is about evidence or fairness, but about determination to remove a president Democrats do not like. This is not how you impeach a president, and this is certainly not justice.

"Democrats resolved on #Impeachment on POTUS's inauguration day. Rep. Al Green even said today, “If the Senate does not convict, that does not mean it’s over,” and then suggested the House could pursue impeachment again on other grounds if the Senate didn't vote to remove POTUS.",1204513104891125763,2019-12-10,21:27:57,usrepgarypalmer,10,11,34
"House Democrats have now unveiled #ArticlesOfImpeachment against President Trump, despite continued lack of evidence.

"“If you accept all their presumptions, it would be obstruction. But impeachments have to be based on proof, not presumptions.”

I applaud the finalization of this rule that will promote work and ensure that SNAP benefits flow to those the program was designed to help. We must do more to move Americans dependent on government benefits into meaningful work and self-sufficiency. https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/12/04/usda-restores-original-intent-snap-second-chance-not-way-life …,1202593112310374400,2019-12-05,14:18:35,usrepgarypalmer,6,4,7

Great to spend the morning at Rising Hope Academy. I shared my personal story and journey to becoming a Congressman. I always value speaking to young people about their potential and how hard work can make a difference in their lives and communities.
