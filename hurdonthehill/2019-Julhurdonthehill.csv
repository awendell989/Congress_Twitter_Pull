Defending and protecting our election machines is just one piece of the puzzle. The Russians also want to see doubt in our elections and in our ability conduct free and fair elections. You don't actually have to penetrate the machine in order to see that doubt. @CNNSitRoom pic.twitter.com/ZEUMiHpRyz,1154529103288111105,2019-07-25,23:09:22,hurdonthehill,76,96,391

Mueller said Russia’s meddling in the ‘16 election “wasn’t a single attempt. They’re doing it as we sit here.” Let’s refocus energy to stop Russian disinformation and interference in our elections.
