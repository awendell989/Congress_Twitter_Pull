This action by the Administration to allow domestic rare earth production is a big U.S. national security victory. http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/17/1972170/0/en/USA-Rare-Earth-and-Texas-Mineral-Resources-Corp-Commend-Federal-Permitting-Improvement-Steering-Council-FPISC-Decision-to-Add-Mining-as-a-Covered-Sector.html …,1218342473724047360,2020-01-18,01:20:56,hurdonthehill,27,28,97
