"Are having baseless investigations on everything from Russian collusion to bribery and finding no crimes, but then impeaching anyway solely to fire up your liberal base an abuse of power?

It‚Äôs ironic that on the exact same day that Pelosi & her followers announce #ArticlesOfImpeachment they also finally agree to #USMCA! Perhaps she wants to drown out the Trump win; or perhaps she wants cover from her dangerously partisan impeachment? pic.twitter.com/MI9xfvHtbq ‚Äì at Rayburn House Office Building,1204430860323155968,2019-12-10,16:01:09,kycomer,18,8,44
