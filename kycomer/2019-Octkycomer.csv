Voted against the #ImpeachmentResolution & then immediately demanded on the House Floor that Pelosi bring the #USMCA to a vote & actually do things the American people expect Congress to do! pic.twitter.com/xEKHOIvDJi,1189952084793286656,2019-10-31,17:07:39,kycomer,277,1407,4617
Pleased that USDA has released #Hemp Regulations. Making hemp a reality was my campaign pledge when I ran for Ag Commissioner in 2011. We did it! And now Kentucky is the model for America in hemp production. #KY1 pic.twitter.com/ngz3siQoKA,1189207736615133185,2019-10-29,15:49:53,kycomer,2,13,65

I appreciate President Trump retweeting a quote from me & my Graves County farmer buddy Jed Clark from a @WPSDLocal6 interview about #USMCA.

As a member of House Oversight I can say w/confidence this Impeachment Inquiry is a partisan political stunt. Pelosi/Schiff know they can‚Äôt defeat @realDonaldTrump in election so this will be (like Mueller Report) another failed attempt to ‚Äúget him!‚Äù https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1181734780112642050¬†‚Ä¶,1182277826571067393,2019-10-10,12:52:54,kycomer,87,139,380
