Legacy of Obamacare: increasing cost of health care to push us onto socialized govt-run health care. Only force to bring down costs is competition. We need to address the problem & it’s not  British model of health care (wealthy get care in U.S. & the rest are left to wait). https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1197573664897716224 …,1197999755080720390,2019-11-22,22:06:14,kencalvert,44,5,19

"So-called “breaking news” of 100,000 migrant children being detained is quickly deleted b/c it happened in 2015…So it’s only a story if it’s current Administration, not the Obama Administration?

FedEx CEO challenges NYT to debate on tax policy.  My money is on Fred Smith.
