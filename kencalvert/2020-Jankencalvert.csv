It would also jeopardize our national security and the safety of our servicemembers by restricting our military’s ability to eliminate imminent threats from Iran.

The U.S. contractor killed last month in Iraq by Iranian-backed terrorists was a California resident with a wife and two young children.

Disproportionate? Soleimani is responsible for the death of hundreds of American soldiers & injuries to thousands more. He was planning more violence against our troops alongside terrorists.
