Thanks to Ms. Nassan & the students at @Seneca_Valley Senior High for inviting me to visit today. Hopefully over the holiday break you’ll take some time to catch up on those classic ‘90’s movies we discussed. #PA17 pic.twitter.com/1zE9sOY5Cl,1206640000701521922,2019-12-16,18:19:29,repconorlamb,24,2,28
No one should have to choose between taking lifesaving medicine & paying for food. H.R. 3 will help seniors & families in #PA17 who face that choice because of the high cost of their prescriptions. https://bit.ly/2YFBisC ,1205217965064572929,2019-12-12,20:08:49,repconorlamb,382,25,113
