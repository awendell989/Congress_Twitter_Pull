Celebrating #Thanksgiving with American troops overseas. There are a lot of men and women separated from their families and friends today because they chose to serve our country. Please keep them in mind as you sit down with your loved ones today. #PA17 pic.twitter.com/3J4XQYuvcc,1200112547740958720,2019-11-28,18:01:43,repconorlamb,71,49,283

This morning @VetAffairsDems held a critical hearing on legislation to address the veteran suicide crisis & hear directly from @DeptVetAffairs @SecWilkie.
