I strongly supported passage of the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019 in the House today. Civilian federal employees go above and beyond to serve our country and our community. They have earned our support.

"Dear Ted:

Thank you for proving my point. You are 1/535 Legislators. So is Nancy Pelosi. Contrary to her claims, she is not equal to the President. She cannot take any action in the house without 218 votes. The President can act with his pen, as he did yesterday. https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/1086076094216790016 …",1086251189442932737,2019-01-18,13:17:19,repmiketurner,140,23,82

I have voted to fully fund our government. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer need to fund border security and reopen our government.
