"Our troops deal with tremendously difficult situations that bring trauma, stress, & absolute danger.

Received new polling info at a meeting at Camp David. It supports my theory that proceeding with impeachment backfires on democrats in the 2020 election-- particularly in swing districts. Also democrat candidates are not polling well vs. @realDonaldTrump. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DXGIiI3h08SA3H15IuP6aN_-9xpqAj0U/view?usp=sharing …,1206009026657607682,2019-12-15,00:32:13,reprussfulcher,44,15,34

There is no doubt that action to lower prescription drug costs is necessary-- and it's important we go about this in the right way. I've put my support behind the bipartisan H.R.19 & hope that we can set aside the extreme partisanship in Congress to secure this win for Americans. https://twitter.com/HouseGOP/status/1204469503599480833 …,1204503368300924934,2019-12-10,20:49:16,reprussfulcher,16,35,100
