"This week my Dem colleagues in @NatResources attempted to remove “Under God” from the oath taken by witnesses before they testify. 

I voted against this removal. 

I think it was God’s divine grace that helped found this nation and allowed us to prosper. https://www.google.com/amp/amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jan/30/god-on-the-outs-with-house-dem-committee-draft-str/ …",1091086022535008256,2019-01-31,21:29:13,reprussfulcher,12,4,21

"I've had a few q's regarding my vote against H.R. 676 (NATO Support Act by Rep. Panetta D-CA) & I would like to explain my vote. First, I am not anti-NATO. Second, H.R.676 would empower foreign leaders with too much authority by locking the U.S. into the current terms of NATO.1/3",1088849947380891654,2019-01-25,17:23:51,reprussfulcher,21,18,46
