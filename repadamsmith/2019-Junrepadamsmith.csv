"It is entirely reasonable for Congress to demand that basic standards of care are met for vulnerable children.  The Senate's version of the emergency supplemental bill did not guarantee these standards, which is why I voted no yesterday.

"#SCOTUS ruling on the #CitizenshipQuestion is a victory, but the fight isn’t over yet. This admin wants to weaponize the census against immigrants and communities of color.

I am appalled by this administration's consistent efforts to separate immigrant families. If you or someone you know could be impacted by the proposed ICE raids it is imperative that you #KnowYourRights. We must continue to fight efforts to target our immigrant communities.,1142188857959436288,2019-06-21,21:53:39,repadamsmith,48,60,126
The proposed #PublicCharge rule is another senseless attempt by the Trump Admin to advance its anti-immigrant agenda at the expense of our communities.
