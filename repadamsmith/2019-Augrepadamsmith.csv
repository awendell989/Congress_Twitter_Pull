The President’s disdain for immigrants continues to show through his rhetoric and his administration’s policies. This new change in policy is just the most recent in a long string of hateful actions aimed directly at immigrants.

The Trump administration’s Title X rule change is a direct attack on Planned Parenthood and the access to health care that millions of women rely on.

Cutting U.S. foreign aid has devastating consequences for communities in need and harms America’s security. I echo the concerns from my colleagues and urge the Administration to listen to the bipartisan opposition to their plan from Congress.,1162485800698875904,2019-08-16,22:06:27,repadamsmith,2,7,22
The Administration’s proposed rescission package for foreign aid is reckless and dangerous. Congress appropriated this money for a reason – the same reason military officials consistently urge investments in development and diplomacy – it makes America safer. https://twitter.com/USGLC/status/1162451034624667653 …,1162485799730012162,2019-08-16,22:06:27,repadamsmith,2,14,22

The Trump Administration’s bigoted revised version of the Statue of Liberty's poem to reflect their new public charge rule doesn’t represent American values or the dignity with which we should treat immigrants. https://twitter.com/politico/status/1161265286898683904 …,1161336421933703168,2019-08-13,17:59:14,repadamsmith,7,20,59
