The Minority Veterans of America celebrates the unique identities of veterans outside of their military service. It was great meeting with Katherine and Eric to talk about how @MinorityVets can be partners in the fight against this Administration's military #transgender ban. pic.twitter.com/2epwxVD3NC,1111709738000138241,2019-03-29,19:20:30,repadamsmith,1,11,22

The President's #TransBan is primarily based on ignorance and bias against the #transgender community. Today Congress went on record that we will not stand for ignorance & bigotry in our military or anywhere else. A vote in this House makes it clear just how wrong this policy is. pic.twitter.com/KxeDuaaUGN,1111292285508075520,2019-03-28,15:41:42,repadamsmith,14,28,79
