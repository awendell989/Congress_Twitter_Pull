The Trump Administration's proposed rule to weaken the #CRA and make it easier for banks to discriminate is just plain wrong. I am working with @FSCDems to stand up for communities of color & help rectify discrimination in housing and mortgage finance. https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-opinion-community-reinvestment-act-changes-20200117-gfheik6y35c3hpcmctysetdnna-story.html …,1218598778946686977,2020-01-18,18:19:24,repchuygarcia,1,2,10

What I saw today is terrible. The Trump Admin should be ashamed of #RemainInMexico and the #TentCourts. There are about 2500 people living in squalor in what used to be a park. They are awaiting their court dates in unsafe and unsanitary conditions. #DemsAtTheBorder pic.twitter.com/0teyxpsVJu,1218226439453016066,2020-01-17,17:39:51,repchuygarcia,9,40,57
The conditions in the camps are heartbreaking. They get water rationed from a bucket. They see a doctor in what looks like a large portapotty. There are so many children. Before Trump’s #RemainInMexico policy these families could wait in the US for their asylum court dates. pic.twitter.com/FNcpGlF5rM,1218211907016019970,2020-01-17,16:42:06,repchuygarcia,22,40,40
