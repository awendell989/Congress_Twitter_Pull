Thx @wusa9 @AnnieYuTV for covering the effort of military spouses to repeal the unfair widow's tax. These families have already sacrificed so much for our country -- they should not have to lobby Congress to get what's rightfully theirs.

"#VAWA19 improves services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The @NRA's opposition to #VAWA is one more reason why I’ll never take a dime from them.
