I am encouraged to see B.C. government taking a more active role in the long overdue clean-up of the Tulsequah Chief mine.

I applaud the nomination of retired General John Abizaid to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. I had the honor of serving as a staff officer to Gen. Abizaid when he was Commander of U.S. Central Command. I can’t think of anyone more knowledgeable and qualified than him.,1063155842952896512,2018-11-15,19:44:40,sendansullivan,4,5,21

"I support the Trump admin's decision to reimpose sanctions lifted under the flawed 2015 nuclear deal.
