"Today with @housebudgetGOP, we had yet another assault on OK's #1 job sector - energy.

The majority has focused so much time into this, we've nearly forgotten our committee's purpose - maybe that's why we still don't have a budget?

This markup in @NatResources today is a slap in the face to the many people who have worked hard to draft legislation that could actually help our country. These bills will never get a vote in the Senate and will certainly never make it to the President's desk.,1151501483826921472,2019-07-17,14:38:42,repkevinhern,2,4,6
"""This committee has become a mockery of democracy and a mockery of good government."" - @RepRobBishop

He's absolutely right. The Democrats on @NatResources don't care about moving our country forward - none of these bills have a shot at becoming law.",1151501483084529665,2019-07-17,14:38:42,repkevinhern,8,11,15
