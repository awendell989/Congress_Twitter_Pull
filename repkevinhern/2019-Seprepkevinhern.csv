We all need to remember that bad people will do bad things.  It is our fundamental right to protect ourselves when we are in a time of distress.  Our 2A is our constitutional freedom to keep and bear arms! https://twitter.com/DanCrenshawTX/status/1169288516301463553 …",1169379742614728704,2019-09-04,22:40:31,repkevinhern,10,3,11
