"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women after skin cancer. As #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth comes to a close, I join my colleagues in continual support of all those affected by this devastating disease. pic.twitter.com/qcjWyUFdnP",1189277864434327554,2019-10-29,20:28:33,repkevinhern,9,2,10
Proof that our efforts are working! Pelosi is bringing the impeachment inquiry to the floor for a vote after several weeks of my colleagues & I demanding transparency & propriety in the process. This is a necessary step to ensure all our voices are heard. https://thehill.com/homenews/house/467776-house-to-vote-this-week-on-impeachment-inquiry-procedures …,1188907081723793413,2019-10-28,19:55:11,repkevinhern,32,13,58
I’m with @SteveScalise @RepMattGaetz & nearly 50 of my colleagues outside the Intelligence Committee room demanding an open and transparent process. We must #StopTheSchiffShow pic.twitter.com/QwMW3YmBle,1187030856738725888,2019-10-23,15:39:44,repkevinhern,3496,4594,11612
I'd encourage any of my colleagues to come on down to @HSBCgop @HouseSmallBiz and listen in on our meetings - TRUE bipartisanship and mutual respect. It's a pleasure to have great leaders like @RepSteveChabot and @NydiaVelazquez setting that example. https://twitter.com/RepSteveChabot/status/1186391754238509056 …,1186682476296626176,2019-10-22,16:35:24,repkevinhern,17,9,25
"House Democrats refuse to make their impeachment inquiry legitimate because they know it's founded on false pretenses. 

To treat @SteveScalise like this is shameful. Impeachment is a bipartisan process, not a one-sided quest for revenge. https://twitter.com/SteveScalise/status/1184251480032854016 …",1184466606396792832,2019-10-16,13:50:19,repkevinhern,169,496,1261
"A lot of people have asked me about this - I signed on as a cosponsor this week! The behavior of Adam Schiff is unacceptable. As the Chair of the Intelligence Committee and a senior House Democrat, @RepAdamSchiff must be held accountable. https://twitter.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1177638910345781248 …",1181634857753034752,2019-10-08,18:17:58,repkevinhern,67,324,726
