"Socialism has failed in every nation that has ever tried it, yet Democrats want America to be a socialist country. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1100471593896157186 …",1100483986722304000,2019-02-26,19:53:23,repmobrooks,17,29,51
"$93 trillion equates to $600,000 per household. If every household earning more than $100,000 were taxed at a 100% rate for 10 years, Democrats would still fall more than $32 trillion short.

I fully support @realDonaldTrump's decision to bar Hoda Muthana from entering the US. She is an extremely dangerous threat to the American people and she should be treated like any other ISIS terrorist. https://www.al.com/news/2019/02/hoda-muthana-not-a-us-citizen-says-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo.html …,1098627655681929219,2019-02-21,16:56:59,repmobrooks,14,14,56

Socialist Democrat’s so-called “Green New Deal” is a raw deal for Americans. The proposal amounts to a vague manifesto of radical Socialist Democrat policies that promises “massive government intervention” and the “economic transformation” of America. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-new-deal-ocasio-cortez-aims-to-make-air-travel-obsolete-aid-those-unwilling-to-work?fbclid=IwAR2P6K2ba9eDZojFGKm4oFZjwIVG6DteHTfyguIAm9-N_HGUBOYmZHccfQs …,1093631860901593093,2019-02-07,22:05:28,repmobrooks,24,13,39
