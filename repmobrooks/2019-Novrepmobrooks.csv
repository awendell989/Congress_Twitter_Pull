"As I told @trish_regan on @FoxBusiness last night, this impeachment charade amounts to Socialist Dems using federal tax dollars to conduct political opposition research to win the White House, House & Senate in the 2020 elections. pic.twitter.com/e57epe9Rda",1197935324040777729,2019-11-22,17:50:12,repmobrooks,42,25,82

"People who commit crimes SHOULD be convicted & punished, regardless of party.  I wish Socialist Dems felt the same way.

Republican senators on Nixon had the integrity to convict and remove him from office (so he resigned).

Joe Biden to Ukraine: “I’m leaving in 6 hours. If the prosecutor [investigating Burisma] is not fired, you’re not getting the [$1 Billion USA] money.”

Trump asks for Ukraine investigation.

Me: No, absolutely not. I thank the president, & I would hope that every president would try to ferret out corruption wherever it may exist.
