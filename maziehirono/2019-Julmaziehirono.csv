It’s past time we give the power back to the people and overturn Citizens United. These corporations shouldn’t have more power than everyday Americans in our democracy. Let’s restore #DemocracyForAll. pic.twitter.com/RYxeDxwa9D,1156354227901521928,2019-07-31,00:01:46,maziehirono,85,593,2217
The cruelty and dysfunction in our immigration system starts with @realDonaldTrump and his hostility towards who he deems as “others” — especially immigrants and people of color. pic.twitter.com/kl9A8mVm7y,1155560892517535744,2019-07-28,19:29:20,maziehirono,356,697,2345
".@realDonaldTrump wants to make it as hard as possible not only to get here, but to stay here. Talk about a rigged system. We need to fix these policies and recognize the humanity of the people seeking refuge at our southern border.",1154903017948438528,2019-07-26,23:55:11,maziehirono,73,144,721
It all starts with an attitude of negativity and prejudice towards what they deem as “others” particularly immigrants. It starts with the Muslim ban this President imposed the minute he got elected. It starts with getting rid of DACA protections. It continues in these facilities.,1154903016287494144,2019-07-26,23:55:10,maziehirono,27,138,628
"We should not be putting unreasonable, cruel road blocks in the way of seeking legal asylum in our country. Like any other immigrant family, these people are seeking a better life. They’re seeking the American dream.",1154903014341337088,2019-07-26,23:55:10,maziehirono,20,68,317
There are alternatives to detaining people in facilities that lead to overcrowding. A lot of these facilities are run by for profit companies. Do you think they want to move these people as fast as possible? We are paying these companies $700-800 per person. You do the math.,1154903012470644741,2019-07-26,23:55:09,maziehirono,22,129,398
"A father broke into tears when @timkaine and I asked him the question. All he wanted to do was to come to this country. Because of the violence in Guatemala, the life of his 7-year-old daughter was threatened. Why would we send him back to a place like that?",1154903010490949632,2019-07-26,23:55:09,maziehirono,21,83,352
"When we got to the facilities, I asked the migrants a question; what do you want for yourself here in this country? They wanted a better future for their children, to be able to attend school, to be reunited with their families. They didn’t want to live under threat of violence.",1154903008569962498,2019-07-26,23:55:08,maziehirono,12,83,322
My friend @timkaine and I visited the El Paso and Clint border stations today to see the conditions that migrant children and their families are experiencing.

"3 things are clear from Mueller today so far:

1) No exoneration.
2) Overwhelming evidence of obstruction.
3) The OLC memo prevented Mueller from indicting Trump.

Mueller confirmed Russia interfered with our elections and will interfere in 2020 if we don’t stop them. We have a President that thinks Russia did nothing wrong and welcomes their support.

Trump and his ultra-right wing base have a symbiotic relationship. They feed his narcissism and he feeds their hatred of others. A match made in totalitarian heaven.,1151934493630042120,2019-07-18,19:19:19,maziehirono,8178,5706,20589

It’s apparent that @realDonaldTrump & @VP have very different definitions of humane and compassionate than the rest of us. Let’s be clear: crowding hundreds of people in cages in sweltering heat without showers or basic necessities is neither humane nor compassionate. pic.twitter.com/9LCSvJ0fFf,1149862102867357696,2019-07-13,02:04:23,maziehirono,1233,1999,5444
