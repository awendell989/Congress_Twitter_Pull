"Today, we took a solemn oath to uphold our constitutional duty in this impeachment process. It should be a fair trial. But unlike any other President, Donald Trump has completely stonewalled Congress by withholding documents and preventing witnesses from testifying. pic.twitter.com/fZYIsTtqMg",1217922678381842432,2020-01-16,21:32:49,maziehirono,65,196,1076
Listening to Mitch McConnell feels like you’re going down the Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole. He keeps trying to rig the trial for the President. Here's the bottom line - is it okay for @realDonaldTrump to shake down the President of another country to do his political bidding? pic.twitter.com/XEhFc7KjV3,1217236179818549249,2020-01-15,00:04:55,maziehirono,94,440,1461
.@realDonaldTrump tried to bribe Ukraine to get dirt on his political rival. It's not a coincidence that Russia brazenly and illegally hacked Burisma looking for that same dirt.

"What I’d like to see is a fair trial – one with relevant witnesses and documents. @realDonaldTrump has told witnesses to not testify. Multiple requests have been sent to the White House, not a single document was produced.

Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are trying to cover-up what the President did by focusing on the process rather than the substance. @realDonaldTrump shook down the President of another country for his own political purposes. That’s what we should be focusing on. pic.twitter.com/z8qWfRn4rz,1215672868350111745,2020-01-10,16:32:52,maziehirono,241,367,1190

"One of the few things that the American people can count on from the reckless Trump administration is prioritizing corporations above all else.

This is a perilous situation. We face a clear choice of war or diplomacy. @realDonaldTrump’s lack of impulse control makes it imperative that Congress reassert its Constitutional authority to prevent an unauthorized war with Iran. https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1214703986323939328 …,1214759373282648064,2020-01-08,04:02:58,maziehirono,109,358,1519
.@realDonaldTrump has appointed 187 judges to the federal bench – that includes 1 in 4 circuit court judges and two Supreme Court seats.
