.@realDonaldTrump has yet again attacked access to reproductive health care by putting arbitrary requirements on health plans that cover abortion. The bottom line is this administration continues to restrict women's access to their constitutionally protected right to abortion. https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1208143885387620353Â â€¦,1208164953636646912,2019-12-20,23:19:06,maziehirono,114,437,924
