His incoherent criticism is on par with other climate change deniers who also seem scared silly to face the facts of climate change.,1102008407618404354,2019-03-03,00:50:53,maziehirono,1760,3034,13862,2019-03-03 00:50:53
Republicans hurt women. Now they're condemning women who  face the agonizing decision of needing a late term abortion. Compassion and understanding are called for in this situation - it is not the time for the heavy hand of government to reach into our wombs. #HowDareYou,1101627134118936576,2019-03-01,23:35:50,maziehirono,2497,4729,17062,2019-03-01 23:35:50
