"AG Barr’s spin on the Mueller report shows he’s acting like the President’s lawyer, not the American people’s lawyer. That’s why I called on the DOJ Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility to look into how he misled the public to protect @realDonaldTrump. pic.twitter.com/q7XeySQ9V7",1123351265961029632,2019-04-30,22:19:47,maziehirono,966,1543,4681

ICYMI: I’ve said since the very beginning that impeachment should be on the table. I want the proceedings to have as much ammunition behind it as possible.

"The Special Counsel’s report in no way exonerates @realDonaldTrump. In fact, it implicates him in criminal activity.
