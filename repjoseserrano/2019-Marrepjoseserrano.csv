"It’s time for Congress to put an end to so-called “junk insurance plans.” If you buy insurance, you should be able to expect it to be there when you need it. That’s why we need the Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions & Making Health Care More Affordable Act! #ProtectOurCare pic.twitter.com/oQbteM2hxq",1112020301045477378,2019-03-30,15:54:34,repjoseserrano,3,4,6

The government has never assessed the effect of the internet on hate crimes.

Once again President Trump has shown he could care less about the millions of American citizens in #PuertoRico. #PuertoRicans deserve adequate & fair levels of funding for nutritional assistance & assistance to continue addressing the island’s needs post #HurricaneMaria.,1111060200352632837,2019-03-28,00:19:28,repjoseserrano,8,37,93
