"ðŸŸ¦ Require @HUDgov, w/ other Fed. agencies, to complete consultation on electrical grid funding for #PuertoRico & the #USVI within 30 days.

The Trump Administration is more interested in delaying needed repairs than in helping the U.S. citizens living in #PuertoRico. Puerto Rico deserves better: https://wapo.st/2u5qp8tÂ ,1217910789165715456,2020-01-16,20:45:34,repjoseserrano,2,8,14
