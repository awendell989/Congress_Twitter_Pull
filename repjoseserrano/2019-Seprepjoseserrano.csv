The Trump Admin continues to stonewall requests from the Congress for the release of the Inspector General report – despite it being required by law. It’s time to put country before partisanship and #ExposeTheTruth. pic.twitter.com/guox2kEDc2,1177041694224723969,2019-09-26,02:06:22,repjoseserrano,7,13,24

Decision by @NYCMayor & @NYCSchools not allowing teachers to join with students in #ClimateChange rallies is a misguided decision. They claim that schools must be free of politics. Since when is saving our planet a political statement? Our city has politicized the issue.,1175147353331961859,2019-09-20,20:38:56,repjoseserrano,0,3,8
"Today we mourn the loss of Puerto Rican trailblazer and former Mayor of Miami Maurice Ferre. First Hispanic Mayor of a major U.S. city, “father” of modern-day Miami, and great leader well-regarded by people across partisan lines.
