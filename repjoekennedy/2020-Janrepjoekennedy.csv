Once again the Trump Administration has chosen corporate interests over working Americans.

They clearly don’t care about the legal justification. But the mere existence of the 2001 & 2002 AUMFs gives them dangerous cover. Both need to be repealed now. https://twitter.com/rgoodlaw/status/1215693931389825025 …,1215718464867926026,2020-01-10,19:34:03,repjoekennedy,13,64,279
