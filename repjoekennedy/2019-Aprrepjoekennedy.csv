Heartbroken for the congregants of Chabad of Poway whose services on the last day of Passover were shattered by bullets guided by antisemitism.

President Trump understands the weight his words carry. His tweet about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar puts her life & her family’s lives at risk. Our outrage should be nonpartisan.
