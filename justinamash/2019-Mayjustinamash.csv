How many times will Congress let the president unilaterally raise taxes on Americans? All the times. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1134240653926232064 …,1134297611454824449,2019-05-31,03:16:39,justinamash,4208,12998,47465

Barr has so far successfully used his position to sell the president’s false narrative to the American people. This will continue if those who have read the report do not start pushing back on his misrepresentations and share the truth.,1133410149996146688,2019-05-28,16:30:12,justinamash,4337,12283,40922
"Ultimately, the special counsel “recogniz[ed] that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily” and chose not to subpoena him because of concerns that the resulting “potentially lengthy constitutional litigation” would delay completion of the investigation.",1133410148398051328,2019-05-28,16:30:11,justinamash,455,4161,18983
The president instead gave written answers to questions submitted by the special counsel. Those answers are often incomplete or unresponsive. Mueller found them “inadequate” and again sought to interview the president.,1133410146883969025,2019-05-28,16:30:11,justinamash,291,3963,17707
The report says the president’s counsel was told that interviewing him was “vital” to Mueller’s investigation and that it would be in the interest of the public and the presidency. Still Trump refused.,1133410145449467904,2019-05-28,16:30:11,justinamash,215,4020,17066
"Barr says the White House “fully cooperated” with the investigation and that Mueller “never sought” or “pushed” to get more from the president, but the report says Mueller unsuccessfully sought an interview with the president for over a year.",1133410143679516672,2019-05-28,16:30:10,justinamash,200,4404,18141
"It’s wrong to suggest that the fact that Mueller did not choose to indict anyone for this means there wasn’t a basis to investigate whether it amounted to a crime or “collusion,” or whether it was in fact part of Russia’s efforts to help Trump’s candidacy.",1133410142387671040,2019-05-28,16:30:10,justinamash,176,3317,16069
"For instance, Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner took a meeting with a Russian lawyer whom Trump Jr. had been told worked for the Russian government and would provide documents to “incriminate Hillary,” as part of the Russian government’s “support for Mr. Trump.”",1133410140949032963,2019-05-28,16:30:10,justinamash,264,3716,16651
"In truth, Mueller’s report describes concerning contacts between members of Trump’s campaign and people in or connected to the Russian government.",1133410139632021509,2019-05-28,16:30:09,justinamash,215,3908,17023
But whether there’s enough evidence for a conviction of a specific crime which Mueller thought was appropriate to charge is a different and much higher standard than whether the people whom Mueller investigated had done anything worthy of investigation.,1133410137987796992,2019-05-28,16:30:09,justinamash,93,2891,14954
Barr notes that Mueller did not “find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign.” He then declares that Mueller found “no collusion” and implies falsely that the investigation was baseless.,1133410136654065667,2019-05-28,16:30:08,justinamash,122,3054,15121
"In subsequent statements and testimony, Barr used further misrepresentations to help build the president’s false narrative that the investigation was unjustified.",1133410135332872192,2019-05-28,16:30:08,justinamash,113,3274,15655
"Barr absurdly replied: “No, I don’t…I suspect that they probably wanted more put out.” Yet Mueller had directly raised those concerns to Barr, and Barr says he “suspect[s]” they “probably” wanted more materials put out, as if Mueller hadn’t directly told him that.",1133410133613137920,2019-05-28,16:30:08,justinamash,129,3319,16460
"Barr was asked about reports “that members of [Mueller’s] team are frustrated…with the limited information included in your March 24th letter, that it does not adequately or accurately necessarily portray the report’s findings. Do you know what they’re referencing with that?”",1133410132338139136,2019-05-28,16:30:07,justinamash,74,2971,14897
"Barr declined; he allowed the confusion to fester and only released the materials three weeks later with the full redacted report. In the interim, Barr testified before a House committee and was misleading about his knowledge of Mueller’s concerns:",1133410130639380481,2019-05-28,16:30:07,justinamash,105,3247,15905
"To “alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen,” Mueller urged the release of the report’s introductions and executive summaries, which he had told Barr “accurately summarize [Mueller’s] Office’s work and conclusions.”",1133410128722575361,2019-05-28,16:30:07,justinamash,81,3226,15687
Mueller: “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.”,1133410126969430016,2019-05-28,16:30:06,justinamash,109,3459,16446
"As a result of Barr’s March 24 letter, the public and Congress were misled. Mueller himself notes this in a March 27 letter to Barr, saying that Barr’s letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.”",1133410125631381506,2019-05-28,16:30:06,justinamash,133,3914,17368
But Mueller’s quote is taken from a section in which he describes other improper motives Trump could have had and notes: “The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.” None of that is in Barr’s letter.,1133410124251508737,2019-05-28,16:30:06,justinamash,127,3577,17094
"Barr quotes Mueller saying the evidence didn’t establish that Trump was personally involved in crimes related to Russian election interference, and Barr then claims that Mueller found that fact relevant to whether the president had the intent to obstruct justice.",1133410122548563968,2019-05-28,16:30:05,justinamash,103,2908,14958
"In noting why Barr thought the president’s intent in impeding the investigation was insufficient to establish obstruction, Barr selectively quotes Mueller to make it sound as if his analysis was much closer to Barr’s analysis than it actually was:",1133410120988332032,2019-05-28,16:30:05,justinamash,101,3248,16487
"But, in fact, Mueller finds considerable evidence that several of Trump’s actions detailed in the report meet the elements of obstruction, and Mueller’s constitutional and prudential issues with indicting a sitting president would preclude indictment regardless of what he found.",1133410119272861696,2019-05-28,16:30:04,justinamash,263,4150,18817
Barr’s letter doesn’t mention those issues when explaining why Mueller chose not to make a prosecutorial decision. He instead selectively quotes Mueller in a way that makes it sound—falsely—as if Mueller’s decision stemmed from legal/factual issues specific to Trump’s actions.,1133410117171449857,2019-05-28,16:30:04,justinamash,241,4200,19759
"Mueller’s report says he chose not to decide whether Trump broke the law because there’s an official DoJ opinion that indicting a sitting president is unconstitutional, and because of concerns about impacting the president’s ability to govern and pre-empting possible impeachment.",1133410115284086785,2019-05-28,16:30:03,justinamash,709,3826,18254
"After receiving Mueller’s report, Barr wrote and released a letter on March 24 describing Barr’s own decision not to indict the president for obstruction of justice. That letter selectively quotes and summarizes points in Mueller’s report in misleading ways.",1133410112847138816,2019-05-28,16:30:03,justinamash,496,4443,20600

Some of the president’s actions were inherently corrupt. Other actions were corrupt—and therefore impeachable—because the president took them to serve his own interests.,1131605831001235458,2019-05-23,17:00:28,justinamash,649,4899,20402

"Every time you hear about U.S.-imposed tariffs, remember that they are taxes on Americans. @POTUS is boasting that he loves collecting big taxes on Americans. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1127337212813742082 …",1127407064240807936,2019-05-12,02:56:04,justinamash,1807,8280,23310
Americans can’t avoid the economic losses caused by tariffs. Tariffs decrease competition and increase the competitive price of goods and services. Even firms that produce entirely domestically face higher input costs. These factors hurt all Americans while benefiting only a few. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1126821318861697024 …,1126945128030048256,2019-05-10,20:20:30,justinamash,467,1263,4490
"Tariffs are being paid to the U.S. government by Americans. These “massive payments,” as @POTUS calls them, are literally paid to the Treasury by U.S. companies in most instances, and the costs are passed on partly or wholly to American consumers. It’s a tax hike on Americans. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1126815126584266753 …",1126878728372523009,2019-05-10,15:56:39,justinamash,386,2020,5476
"A trade deficit is not a loss of money. If you buy from a supermarket or go to a movie, you have a trade deficit, but you have not lost money; you get stuff (groceries, entertainment, etc.) in exchange for your dollars. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1126810275255136256 …",1126844039691677699,2019-05-10,13:38:49,justinamash,1200,2752,10938

I claim liberty to be the highest virtue. The fact I have contributed least to deficits and the debt is simply a byproduct of my dedication to liberty.,1124477554663018496,2019-05-04,00:55:15,justinamash,4,4,21

I acknowledged such when I voted for it. But why focus your criticism on the person in Congress who has contributed least to deficits and the debt? I replied to Sahil because he made an easily verifiable false statement. Centrist Democrats are not the top deficit hawks.,1124466245519249408,2019-05-04,00:10:19,justinamash,4,0,17

"Just do the math. If you’re suggesting I’m not the biggest deficit hawk, then you’re wrong—even with the tax cut. The tax law is roughly $150B/year.
