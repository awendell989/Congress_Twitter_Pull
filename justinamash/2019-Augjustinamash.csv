"Donald Trump is a threat to liberty in America. He has grown government, centralized power, and undermined rights. He has promoted division and contempt. He appears increasingly unstable. In 2020, we must elect someone who will restore respect for our Constitution and each other.",1165018079908237312,2019-08-23,21:48:49,justinamash,4564,12685,55936

"Anti-Semitism is always reprehensible, and it’s perhaps most disturbing when it comes from the president of the United States. President Trump’s “disloyalty” comment mirrors divisive words that have come from members of Congress. This language has no place in political discourse. https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1163905031806050310 …",1163952812608409600,2019-08-20,23:15:50,justinamash,694,2613,10629
"I’ve stated how both parties routinely violate the Constitution. Let me get more specific: votes on Syria and Yemen wars, FISA 702, omnibus spending bills and budget deals, Ex-Im, FOSTA/SESTA, and removal of anti-civil asset forfeiture provisions from final bills.",1163548768429625346,2019-08-19,20:30:18,justinamash,2,7,35
"Given your question, it didn’t occur to me that you were replying to this list. Major bipartisan votes or actions have supported or continued all these things. These are pretty big ones. What else are you looking for?",1163517195416215552,2019-08-19,18:24:51,justinamash,4,1,16
Here’s a (very) partial list. These are all fairly recent issues that have had votes. Both parties failed to uphold our Constitution. https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1163277069939302400?s=21 …,1163506210559184896,2019-08-19,17:41:12,justinamash,1,2,16
"No, but Trump supports unconditional spying if he’s not the target. He signed FISA 702 into law and endorsed the Patriot Act/Freedom Act.",1163476752494190597,2019-08-19,15:44:08,justinamash,3,9,66
"Trump’s presidency is the natural outcome of the not-my-side-ism that pervades today’s politics. When you’re convinced the other side is uniquely responsible for the country’s ills, you’re liable to vote for anyone, no matter how unsavory, who will keep the others out of power.",1163468392684294149,2019-08-19,15:10:55,justinamash,1613,3627,18034

Trump has not kept any such promises. He’s kept us in unauthorized wars. He’s expanded unconstitutional spying. He’s signed record amounts of wasteful spending. He’s promoted corporate welfare. He’s supported new federal crimes. And he’s authorized more abusive asset forfeiture.,1163279530791972864,2019-08-19,02:40:27,justinamash,37,97,470
"The two parties sometimes violate different rights, but often they work together against the people: unauthorized wars, unconstitutional spying, wasteful spending, corporate welfare, overcriminalization, asset forfeiture, etc. That they are not equally bad does not make one good.",1163277069939302400,2019-08-19,02:30:40,justinamash,428,1506,6556

"President Trump is now demanding a permanent reauthorization of the NSA’s unconstitutional, warrantless program to collect Americans’ phone records.

We must demand that he and Congress respect the Fourth Amendment!",1162780176289325056,2019-08-17,17:36:12,justinamash,722,7370,23429

"Last year, Pres. Trump signed FISA 702. This year, he wants to reauthorize the Patriot Act and Freedom Act. These unconstitutional domestic spying programs must end.

"Israel should stand up to President Trump and allow our colleagues to visit. Nobody has to agree with their opinions, but it will inevitably harm U.S.-Israel relations if members of Congress are banned from the country.

Thank you for illustrating why Americans shouldn’t trust that your red flag law won’t be used arbitrarily to violate our rights. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1161277403353759744 …,1161318754246176768,2019-08-13,16:49:01,justinamash,857,5862,27749
"Nobody has more power to influence the tone of public discourse than the president. Instead of blaming everyone and everything else for inciting resentment and hate, President Trump should check his own words and actions.

"There was a time when the GOP establishment hated Donald Trump. They then realized they could use a man like this—unprincipled, transactional, shameless—to push their agenda. McConnell and McCarthy are giddy about Trump. Conservatives in Congress are the ones privately horrified.",1157017369304358913,2019-08-01,19:56:51,justinamash,6829,18046,66800

"Same message we hear from the GOP establishment every time: Spend now. Cut later.

Donald Trump is the most politician-y person we’ve ever seen in government. It’s like the establishment created him in a laboratory to help promote their BS. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156935288322699265 …",1156942889412452352,2019-08-01,15:00:54,justinamash,620,3039,11986
"An important note for people talking about the federal budget:

Spending bills are valued over a one-year period. Tax bills are valued over a 10-year period.

In other words, a $1.3T spending bill is 10x larger than a $1.3T tax bill. The spending bill has 10x the deficit impact.",1156767855138004994,2019-08-01,03:25:23,justinamash,193,1869,6336
