House Democrats' call to limit President Trump’s powers in Iran is nothing but partisan politics. Qassem Soleimani was one of the most merciless terrorists who has been directly and indirectly responsible for over 600 American deaths.

For too long Iran has funded terrorism and threatened the stability of the Middle East & the world.
