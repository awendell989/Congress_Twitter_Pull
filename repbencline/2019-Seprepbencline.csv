"On the first day of my Sixth District Farm Tour, I had the opportunity to visit Showalter’s Orchards & Greenhouse, @WOLF_Lavender, Marshall Farms, and Cave View Farms.

"Yesterday, @POTUS and @JPN_PMO announced a trade deal that will eliminate or reduce tariffs on $7.2 billion of U.S. food and agricultural products, helping U.S. beef, corn, pork and other farmers.
