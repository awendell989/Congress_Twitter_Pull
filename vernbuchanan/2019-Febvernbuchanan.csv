Great discussion today at delegation hearing I chaired with @RepHastingsFL on water quality issues. 16 members from both parties attended. Harmful Algal Blooms including Red Tide and no oil drilling off the coast dominated.

Members of Congress shouldn‚Äôt get paid if they don‚Äôt do their job. That‚Äôs why I co-sponsored a bill to block paychecks for senators and congressmen during any future government shutdowns. I just donated my pay during the recent shutdown to three local charities. #Sayfie pic.twitter.com/GUbPHSjM2m,1095329353951600640,2019-02-12,14:30:42,vernbuchanan,11,15,47
