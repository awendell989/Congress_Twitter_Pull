The slaughter of horses for consumption is a barbaric practice that has no place in America. I will continue to lead the effort with @RepSchakowsky to ban domestic horse slaughter and end the export of horses abroad for the same purpose. #Sayfie https://bit.ly/2Sf0chZ ,1090687313640869889,2019-01-30,19:04:54,vernbuchanan,74,278,374
The torture of animals should be a federal crime with stiff penalties. My bill with Democrat @RepTedDeutch ​has overwhelming bipartisan support.

Simplifying the federal financial aid process is critical to allowing more students to attend college. Democrat @RepLloydDoggett and I introduced the Student Aid Simplification Act to make it happen. #Sayfie  https://bit.ly/2WfF4aH ,1088830304780013573,2019-01-25,16:05:48,vernbuchanan,10,5,23
I will continue to fight for our veterans and demand accountability from the @DeptVetAffairs. It is unacceptable that 22 American veterans take their lives every day. @mysuncoast #Sayfie pic.twitter.com/CuoemNmXod,1088504631683149825,2019-01-24,18:31:42,vernbuchanan,5,14,25

The torture of innocent animals is abhorrent and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Protecting animals from cruelty is a top priority for me and I look forward to working with Democratic @RepTedDeutch on this important issue. #Sayfie https://twitter.com/HeraldTribune/status/1088150542189244418 …,1088156315715805185,2019-01-23,19:27:37,vernbuchanan,71,132,258
