"Honored to be recognized by @HumaneSociety with my friend @RepHastingsFL for our work to end the slaughter of dogs & cats sold for their meat.

Sad and disturbing to hear that a Starbucks coffee shop in Arizona asked six police officers to leave after a customer said they didn’t feel safe with police nearby. Do you think the officers should have been asked to leave?,1148305815880839168,2019-07-08,19:00:15,vernbuchanan,25,6,8
