"Another reminder of the perils America’s police officers face, even on Christmas Eve. The #ThinBlueLine answers the call to protect our communities. @PBCountySheriff mourning the sacrifice of #K9Cigo, who is crediting with saving lives. #Sayfie  https://bit.ly/2QTUUsw ",1078022585395359751,2018-12-26,20:19:47,vernbuchanan,4,7,15

I will not be accepting any pay for as long as the federal government remains shut down. This is yet another sad example of Washington’s dysfunction and inability to compromise. #Sayfie pic.twitter.com/2JsTev0jwk,1076258680960679936,2018-12-21,23:30:40,vernbuchanan,115,160,803

The First Step Act will make communities safer by strengthening rehabilitation programs so that prisoners who leave jail don’t return to a life of crime. Our justice system should be tough but fair. pic.twitter.com/9QfHqcqCeR,1075832029130956801,2018-12-20,19:15:18,vernbuchanan,4,4,13
Good to see bipartisanship is not dead in Washington. Congress overwhelmingly passed with my support a bill to reform the criminal justice system and save taxpayers money.,1075832028388622337,2018-12-20,19:15:18,vernbuchanan,5,4,14
I am demanding answers from @DeptVetAffairs after it was reported that it failed to spend millions of dollars allocated for suicide prevention efforts in 2018. Unacceptable & disgraceful to the millions of veterans nationwide who put their lives on the line protecting our freedom pic.twitter.com/zk8whVPQhy,1075496415281987586,2018-12-19,21:01:41,vernbuchanan,12,13,25
This report’s findings are a disgrace to our veterans who put their lives on the line protecting our freedom. I will be demanding answers from the @DeptVetAffairs and taking action in Congress to address these failures. https://bit.ly/2ExJ27U ,1075416978750365696,2018-12-19,15:46:02,vernbuchanan,4,6,12
Major Matthew Golsteyn potentially facing the death penalty is DRACONIAN. He is a decorated war veteran who protected American and Afghan soldiers fighting alongside him. Good to see President Trump is reviewing his case. https://twitter.com/MilitaryTimes/status/1074404808306638848 …,1074700978321022976,2018-12-17,16:20:54,vernbuchanan,7,12,16
