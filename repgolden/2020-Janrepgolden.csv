"The House has passed important legislation to lower Rx drug costs, fight corruption & big money in politics, and many other priorities.

Public support for unions is at a 50-year high. The PRO Act is a bipartisan bill with over 200 cosponsors.

So why wait to pass #PROActNow?",1215347964874514432,2020-01-09,19:01:49,repgolden,3,6,11

That's why we need #PROActNow",1215347963314216967,2020-01-09,19:01:49,repgolden,8,18,29
