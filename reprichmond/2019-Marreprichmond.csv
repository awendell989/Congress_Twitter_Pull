"My heart goes out to all Iowans. Though it unsettles me that @SteveKingIA would dare compare them to the countless victims of Katrina, many of whom lost their lives. When people show you who they are, believe them. Steve King is a white supremacist and I won’t stand for it.",1108885184408182784,2019-03-22,00:16:44,reprichmond,89,321,901

I’m upset and disturbed to hear about the targeted hate and bigotry that resulted in the attacks of the Al Noor and Linwood Mosques in New Zealand. We must stand in solidarity with our Muslim brothers and sisters around the world to denounce Islamophobia and all forms of hate.,1106632093352763392,2019-03-15,19:03:45,reprichmond,5,4,35

It’s been 3 months since @SecNielsen has testified before Congress and even more families have been separated since then. I’ll be asking about the Administration’s border policy at the @HomelandDems hearing later this morning.,1103302573136728064,2019-03-06,14:33:26,reprichmond,15,19,57
