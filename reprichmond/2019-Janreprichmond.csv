Southeast Asian Americans are here largely because of the Vietnam War. The time is now to help protect these communities from deportation. They’ve played a major role in my district and in cities all across America. #RefugeeResilience,1088881670260961280,2019-01-25,19:29:55,reprichmond,6,46,134
I join the countless individuals in the disappointment over Sunday’s NFC Championship game and am eager to hear from @nflcommish directly. All teams deserve equal treatment and the @Saints were clearly denied fair treatment.

"I have long called out @SteveKingIA for his racist remarks. While his trajectory of racism is nothing new, it is becoming impossible to ignore.

The president is celebrating having the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history with this announcement when he arrives in New Orleans today. Let’s see if he will discuss the thousands of federal employees working without pay and Louisiana farmers losing money. pic.twitter.com/aJ5giCUNgs,1084846322287603712,2019-01-14,16:14:53,reprichmond,25,15,51

Democrats are not the problem @doc_strategy. We have presented legislation that would reopen the government since the beginning of this Congress. That’s what we call taking a stand.,1083117688292028422,2019-01-09,21:45:54,reprichmond,4,0,2
"The president didn’t say anything tonight that we haven’t already heard him say before.
