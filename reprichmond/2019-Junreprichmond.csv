One of the greatest joys and responsibilities in life is fatherhood. Leading by example is a must since your children are always watching. They might even follow in your footsteps one day. Happy #FathersDay! pic.twitter.com/8R4GCsyA0l,1140266284397019136,2019-06-16,14:34:01,reprichmond,4,9,95

This was the same man who went out of his way to take out a full page ad calling for the return of the death penalty and placed false guilt on five innocent young men. Now he admittedly welcomes help from foreign governments. You can’t get any more morally bankrupt than this. https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1138936855573999616 …,1139190618385788929,2019-06-13,15:19:43,reprichmond,5,11,32
This has been a tough week for the city of New Orleans having lost another native legend. Dr. John was a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer who proudly spread New Orleans culture through his music. May his soul Rest In Peace and his music live on forever.,1137008316842987520,2019-06-07,14:48:01,reprichmond,1,3,24
"Leah Chase was truly one of a kind. Her contributions to New Orleans, the entire state of Louisiana, the rest of the world as we know it are inimitable. She has always been in my corner and will be sorely missed. pic.twitter.com/zDVJPUokMj",1135201263472205826,2019-06-02,15:07:26,reprichmond,2,9,58
New Orleans has suffered a great loss with the passing of Leah Chase. Leah’s impact to New Orleans is immeasurable. She broke barriers as a leading chef and champion of the Civil Rights Movement. My condolences are with the Chase family at this time. May she Rest In Peace.,1135072140003143681,2019-06-02,06:34:21,reprichmond,4,45,169
