"Congratulations to New Orleans native Albert Woodfox for his book, Solitary, being on this year’s @NewYorker National Book Awards list. Albert’s fight for freedom was long fought and earned.

Cokie Roberts was one of a kind. Her trailblazing work and brilliant leadership served as an inspiration to many. New Orleans and the rest of the world has lost a legend. I am saddened by her loss and send my condolences to her family in need of solace at this time. pic.twitter.com/gpbdAxvuMb,1174040495498158081,2019-09-17,19:20:41,reprichmond,1,3,28
