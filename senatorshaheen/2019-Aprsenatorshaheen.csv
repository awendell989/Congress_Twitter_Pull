This is an important step forward but it doesn't go far enough. I’ll continue to call for a vote on my bipartisan bill to prevent the delivery of the F-35 aircraft until Turkey abandons its plans to obtain the Russian S-400 air defense system.,1112835658576547840,2019-04-01,21:54:31,senatorshaheen,0,9,31
I’m glad the administration is heeding the bipartisan call in Congress to delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey. We need to ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin. https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1112787207876698114 …,1112835657553100800,2019-04-01,21:54:30,senatorshaheen,5,18,59

"Every American should have access to affordable, quality health care. This morning, I introduced a health care affordability package, which includes three pieces of legislation that would reduce health care costs for patients and expand access to critical medical services.",1112821366380793857,2019-04-01,20:57:43,senatorshaheen,20,15,58
