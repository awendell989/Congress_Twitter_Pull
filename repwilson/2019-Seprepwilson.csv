House Democrats are taking steps to pass a bill to lower prescription drug prices. No one should have to ration their meds or do without food or utilities to pay for prescriptions.

The Lower Drug Costs Now Act caps negotiated drug prices at prices charged in other nations so that drug companies stop ripping off Americans while charging consumers in other countries less for the same drugs. #LowerDrugCosts pic.twitter.com/1ZqAMyG6cu,1177304275787157504,2019-09-26,19:29:47,repwilson,0,8,21
