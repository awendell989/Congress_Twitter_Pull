"Disturbing that @SecPompeo reportedly treats his State Dept security detail like “UberEats with guns."" If true & unjustified, Pompeo is latest Trump official to use power for personal gain. Reported acts trivialize the DS mission: protecting our diplomats. https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pompeo-democrats-whistleblower-claims/index.html …",1146093594526265344,2019-07-02,16:29:40,senmarkey,12,25,66

"Reports about new North Korea talks are promising, but if reports are right, we can’t simply declare it a nuclear weapons state and move on. We should push Kim Jong Un to commit in writing to a missile and nuclear test ban as a first step. We need more than just a freeze. https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1145546324747653120 …",1145747783279943680,2019-07-01,17:35:33,senmarkey,1,6,14
Massachusetts has some of the most life-saving gun safety laws on the books. My and @RepJoeKennedy + @RepPressley’s MASS Act will encourage other states to implement our proven methods and share in our success in reducing deaths from gun violence. https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/06/29/markey-pressley-kennedy-propose-federal-grants-for-states-that-adopt-mass-gun-laws/C3gr1IwK16AMMF5oxuoHRK/story.html …,1145728885042176007,2019-07-01,16:20:27,senmarkey,14,14,68
