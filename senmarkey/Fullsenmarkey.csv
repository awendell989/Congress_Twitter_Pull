Homeland Security is trying to force every American traveling through our airports to subject themselves to facial recognition tech. That’s an outrageous invasion of privacy. I’ll soon be introducing legislation to stop this intrusive surveillance program. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeland-security-facial-recognition-expansion-plan-slammed-by-senator-ed-markey …,1202258986944409600,2019-12-04,16:10:54,senmarkey,6,11,65,2019-12-04 16:10:54
The flu kills thousands of Americans every year. A vaccine that works against all strains would be a breakthrough & would save lives. That’s why I’m fighting to pass my legislation to boost @NIH funding to $1 billion for research into a universal vaccine. https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/29/health/universal-flu-vaccine/index.html …,1201992283563933697,2019-12-03,22:31:06,senmarkey,3,13,39,2019-12-03 22:31:06
Corporations should not be allowed to exploit the work schedules of their part-time employees. Proud to join @SenWarren and Rep. @JanSchakowsky on this legislation that will empower part-time workers and help protect them from abuse. https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1201911660216246272 …,1201980923392266240,2019-12-03,21:45:58,senmarkey,4,14,35,2019-12-03 21:45:58

This would amount to disturbing government coercion. The recent data breach at CBP shows Homeland Security cannot be trusted to keep our information secure. I will soon introduce legislation to ensure that innocent Americans are never forced to hand over facial recognition info. https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1201720272153387009 …,1201962417724493824,2019-12-03,20:32:26,senmarkey,8,17,64,2019-12-03 20:32:26
Will Trump’s newly confirmed Secretary of Energy rubber stamp a U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement that could reward Saudi Arabia’s disregard for human rights and fast-track its quest for nuclear weapons?

Eversource is moving forward with its plan to build an electrical substation in East Boston that will be within 800 feet of 8 million gallons of jet fuel and across the street from a playground. The State Energy Facilities Siting Board must reassess its approval of this decision: pic.twitter.com/dWy76ziO0b,1201893251994804224,2019-12-03,15:57:36,senmarkey,4,13,42,2019-12-03 15:57:36

Preserving emergency personnel’s access to T-Band spectrum isn’t a partisan issue. I commend @AjitPaiFCC for joining the coalition calling on Congress to protect the T-Band.
