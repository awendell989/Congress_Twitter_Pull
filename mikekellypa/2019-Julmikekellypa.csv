"Great news for the millions of workers employed by small businesses! Thank you, @USDOL.

Now we need the Senate to pass the #SECUREAct to help Americans increase savings during their working years to build security for their golden years. https://twitter.com/USDOL/status/1155824912298389505¬†‚Ä¶",1155868355091472385,2019-07-29,15:51:05,mikekellypa,4,13,6
I voted 'NO' on the budget agreement. America is driving toward a fiscal cliff and this deal puts more pressure on the gas pedal. Democrats rejected modest spending cuts to pay for increased spending overall. We must acknowledge that this can't continue forever.,1154502091781660674,2019-07-25,21:22:02,mikekellypa,34,24,49
"Thank you, @ScottGottliebMD. I've heard conflicting info. Generic drug makers say they can produce true generic insulin *without* technical challenges. They merely lack an approval pathway at @US_FDA. @FDACommissioner Sharpless: What's your take on this urgent matter? https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1154153618171465729¬†‚Ä¶",1154429453273092096,2019-07-25,16:33:24,mikekellypa,1,22,10
".@ScottGottliebMD: To be clear, are you saying generic drug makers can file an ANDA w/@US_FDA today & be approved for true #GenericInsulin?

America isn't about minimums. Nobody comes to America for a minimum wage increase. They come to America for maximum opportunity! Dems had a chance to lift all boats in 2017 but opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Now they turn their back on workers again with job-killing policies. pic.twitter.com/1oiWZCDCeN,1151894978785886209,2019-07-18,16:42:18,mikekellypa,72,59,67
".@HouseDemocrats say they're helping workers w/ $15/hour min wage, which @USCBO says would eliminate 1 million+ jobs. They opposed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, which gave workers the best economy in 50 yrs. If they want America to soar, they should stop putting roadblocks in the way!",1151861828764545025,2019-07-18,14:30:35,mikekellypa,80,48,138
"Too generous? Too good? That doesn't make any sense. That's why we're voting today to get rid of Obamacare's Cadillac Tax, which will put a 40% penalty on high-cost employer sponsored health insurance plans. I'm glad we came together to stop this tax on American families! pic.twitter.com/LNBssZxYXP",1151597740901765125,2019-07-17,21:01:11,mikekellypa,208,62,227
"Today, the House will vote to repeal Obamacare's so-called ""Cadillac Tax,"" a punitive penalty on employer-provided health insurance. This tax never made sense & discourages employers from offering good benefits to workers!

"American diabetics are struggling with an insulin affordability crisis. Over the last two decades, the price of this life-saving drug is up 600%! Generic insulin on the market would bring down the cost, so today I asked @US_FDA about pathways toward this goal! pic.twitter.com/Tmh0sZgVnW",1151128562776363008,2019-07-16,13:56:50,mikekellypa,97,16,57
"#USMCA is a big win for America. Our farmers, ranchers, businesses, & workers stand to gain substantial benefits from this agreement. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump & @USTradeRep negotiated a 21st century trade deal for our 21st century economy.
