"As I mentioned yesterday, if @SpeakerPelosi is serious about addressing the border crisis, she‚Äôll bring a bipartisan bill to the House floor that @POTUS will sign. The Senate, which passed a bill 84-8, just gave her that opportunity. The @HouseGOP is ready to pass it now!",1143996954604691456,2019-06-26,21:38:23,mikekellypa,17,8,22
"#USMCA protects US innovators because Canada & Mexico will: 

üí°Do more to protect IP
‚è±Ô∏èApprove patent apps more quickly 
üè•Increase market access for US medical innovations

Why delay these great benefits for U.S. companies and inventors? Let's pass #USMCAnow! pic.twitter.com/OzUCvLHTT8",1143890378917068802,2019-06-26,14:34:53,mikekellypa,59,329,954
"Until @SpeakerPelosi believes a solution to the border crisis is more important than political points, Americans and migrants will continue to suffer. Let‚Äôs pass a bill that addresses humanitarian AND security issues, & give @DHSgov & @TheJusticeDept what they need!",1143697698572447751,2019-06-26,01:49:14,mikekellypa,114,248,1187
"I was honored to work w/ @repjohnlewis on the Taxpayer First Act, which will head to @POTUS later today!

This is the first reform of the IRS in two decades. It will make the agency a resource, not an adversary, for U.S. taxpayers. When we work together, great things happen. pic.twitter.com/h2Vum0ZSSq",1142086192940421120,2019-06-21,15:05:41,mikekellypa,21,28,104
"Mexico ratified #USMCA and is working to address the border crisis by helping stem the flow of migrants north. We‚Äôre getting more help from the Mexican government than @HouseDemocrats on border security and fair trade.

"#MedicareforAll is quality care for none. Here's what it would mean for American families:

Long lines.
No choice.
Higher taxes.
Broken promises to seniors. 

Americans want us to improve what's broken and preserve what isn't, not throw out what's good with the fixable. pic.twitter.com/G8jikok3BT",1141005561498144768,2019-06-18,15:31:39,mikekellypa,22,14,30
"The #USMCA delay hurts American farmers. Passing it will:

‚úÖPreserve duty-free access to Mexico.
‚úÖExpand duty-free access to Canada for dairy & other products.
‚úÖRemove uncertainty for farmers & ranchers.

All of this is good for U.S. consumers & producers. Let's get it done!",1140983961784635397,2019-06-18,14:05:49,mikekellypa,25,62,118
"Happy Flag Day! On June 14, 1777, Congress adopted the American flag, which is a symbol of freedom & liberty. Many have fought & died for that flag since the revolution, so it's fitting that it shares a bday w/ the @USArmy, created on this date in 1775. #FlagDay2019 #ArmyBDay pic.twitter.com/Q6jxFrrRTm",1139549566339100672,2019-06-14,15:06:03,mikekellypa,52,85,313
"Glad to see the Taxpayer First Act is heading to @potus for signature! This bipartisan bill, the first reform of the IRS since 1998, will make it a service-first agency and a resource rather than an adversary for American taxpayers.

Witness at W&M Cmte hearing just said that bureaucrats in Washington will decide who is eligible for treatments and that individual choice in healthcare would be diminished under #MedicareForAll. Do @HouseDemocrats really want a one-size-fits-all Hcare system controlled in D.C.?,1138823080929910789,2019-06-12,14:59:15,mikekellypa,26,8,12
"Today, the House Ways & Means Cmte will hold a hearing on #MedicareForAll. Americans want to protect what works and improve what doesn't. M4A would take away private plans and force everyone on gov healthcare. No choice, longer waits, & broken promises to seniors.

"Each day we delay USMCA, U.S. workers and industry lose opportunity.  When NAFTA was written, the internet wasn't major part of commerce. USMCA creates new standards for digital trade.
