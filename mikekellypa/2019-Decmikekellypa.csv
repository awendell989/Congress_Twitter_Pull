"Last night, Democrats impeached @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. Today, the House passes a trade deal that's one of his top priorities. What a difference a day makes.

#USMCA is a big win for America, a Christmas present for workers & farmers wrapped in red, white, & blue wrapping paper!",1207708833612738560,2019-12-19,17:06:38,mikekellypa,65,130,450
"Irony: Dems accuse @realDonaldTrump of abuse of power while blatantly abusing theirs w/ a partisan impeachment of an elected president. Their self-righteous references to oaths & the Constitution obscure the obvious intent: political vengeance.

"Prescription drug policy should be about people, not politics!

I oppose H.R. 3 because it means #FewerCures.

I support H.R. 19 because it means #MoreCures.
