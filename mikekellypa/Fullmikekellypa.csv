"These hearings are nothing more than a show. Democrats made up their mind to impeach the day @POTUS @realDonaldTrump was elected. They will stop at nothing to achieve that goal.

"Adam Schiff’s impeachment screen play isn’t turning out as he hoped. Act I was the Russia collusion hoax, which failed to give him his chosen ending. Then came Act II, the tall tale of Ukraine.

"Whistleblower attorney in 2017 talked of coup & rebellion.

His client coordinated w/ Schiff on the complaint that started the inquiry. Their star witness Taylor wasn’t on call & never spoke to @POTUS.
