"After weeks of Adam Schiff's secret hearings & selective leaks, the Do-Nothing-Dems are trying to legitimize the unfair inquiry already underway. This resolution is a mirage â€“ a false sense of fairness, transparency & due process. This sham contains none of those American values.",1189927773961433089,2019-10-31,15:31:03,mikekellypa,2472,8411,27655
"America sent a clear message this weekend: we wonâ€™t rest until ISIS & other terrorists are brought to justice. The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a leader of ISIS, is a major victory in the war on terror. I thank the brave men & women in uniform who carried out this mission.",1188816355732180992,2019-10-28,13:54:41,mikekellypa,19,38,171
"I support @RepublicanStudy's plan for personalized & affordable #HealthCare4U.

The status quo doesn't work, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. We can make healthcare affordable again by empowering patients and rejecting a government-run health system! pic.twitter.com/iWwjWYJ1f4",1186675377445462016,2019-10-22,16:07:12,mikekellypa,20,14,22
"Thereâ€™s a lot at risk here. Drug prices only matter if theyâ€™re on the shelf. @SpeakerPelosi's price-fixing scheme means #FewerCures & fewer jobs because it discourages investment in new life-saving medicines, a process that's already regulated, time consuming, & risky. pic.twitter.com/6EOtAGcPc5",1186641446264332288,2019-10-22,13:52:22,mikekellypa,10,14,34
"For years, @RepAdamSchiff has mislead the American people to bolster his case for impeachment of @potus @realDonaldTrump. Tall tales, outright lies, secret partisan hearings and selective leaks. All unacceptable conduct. Tonight, I will vote to #CensureAdamSchiff.",1186407342256119809,2019-10-21,22:22:07,mikekellypa,286,907,2718

".@HouseDemocrats have used their time in the majority to pass messaging bills that only the far left can stomach. Now theyâ€™re focused solely on impeachment of @POTUS while blaming Republicans for the fact that Congress canâ€™t get anything done. 

Americans deserve better!",1182690588103196677,2019-10-11,16:13:04,mikekellypa,1207,2523,7010
"Impeachment isnâ€™t a game but @HouseDemocrats are treating it like one. Americans elected their reps to solve problems, not undo elections they canâ€™t accept.

I just signed on to @RepAndyBiggsAZ's resolution to censure @RepAdamSchiff for lying to the public about @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's call with the Ukrainian president.
