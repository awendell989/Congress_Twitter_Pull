"When President Obama ordered the elimination of Osama bin Laden, Republicans cheered his decision. Last night, Democrats showed more concern over the 2020 election than the loss of American lives. @POTUS @Realdonaldtrump was right to eliminate one of the world's top terrorists. pic.twitter.com/xYBoBGG9gA",1215648812167057408,2020-01-10,14:57:17,mikekellypa,153,1123,2233
".@POTUS @realDonaldTrump was right to eliminate Qasem Soleimani, one of one of the world's most dangerous terrorists. Sadly, House Democrats have turned this win for America into a political spectacle.

"After years of aggression and the last administration's appeasement policy, America is confronting the world’s largest state sponsor of terror under @POTUS @realDonaldTrump’s leadership.

The death of Qassem Soleimani is a triumph of good over evil. Those who seek to kill and harm Americans and other innocent people will face justice.
