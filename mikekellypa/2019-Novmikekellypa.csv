"One year ago today, @potus @realDonaldTrump signed #USMCA, but instead of passing it next week, the House will enter the next phase of the impeachment scam.

Americans deserve better than the political games Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are playing.",1200812768879882241,2019-11-30,16:24:08,mikekellypa,620,3992,9449

"More of the same from Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats who have put politics ahead of good policy for the American people all year.

"Nearly 10% of Americans are diabetic, and they are facing an insulin affordability crisis. The insulin market needs generic competition. That's why I wrote HR 4244, the MAGIC Act, to establish a clear & permanent path to generic insulin approval at @USFDA.

"These hearings are nothing more than a show. Democrats made up their mind to impeach the day @POTUS @realDonaldTrump was elected. They will stop at nothing to achieve that goal.

"Adam Schiff’s impeachment screen play isn’t turning out as he hoped. Act I was the Russia collusion hoax, which failed to give him his chosen ending. Then came Act II, the tall tale of Ukraine.

"Whistleblower attorney in 2017 talked of coup & rebellion.

His client coordinated w/ Schiff on the complaint that started the inquiry. Their star witness Taylor wasn’t on call & never spoke to @POTUS.

The dossier & Mueller failed. Act III of the impeachment saga is failing too. https://twitter.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/826262311560216578 …",1192462737777078272,2019-11-07,15:24:06,mikekellypa,266,981,2028
"Yesterday I asked Speaker Pelosi to make public all depositions from the impeachment inquiry.
