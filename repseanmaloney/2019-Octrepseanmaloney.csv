I have 100% confidence in @RepAdamSchiff. Trump's rhetoric here is outrageous and irresponsible. It's clear this abuse is politically motivated. Adam is a good man who is enormously careful.

I don't understand the GOP's position here. Are they saying we should rush this before we get the facts? Before we've had all the key people come in and explain themselves? Before we've seen the documents? That's not going to happen. We're not going to be stonewalled.  https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1180160688926416897 … pic.twitter.com/xts2TsOgRD,1180296285145972736,2019-10-05,01:38:57,repseanmaloney,20,46,135
It's heartbreaking that we've come to a point where an American president is engaged in an unholy alliance between foreign policy and his own political advantage AND is corrupting diplomats and civil servants to further that scheme.  https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1180188930286800897 … pic.twitter.com/jucXIUB96n,1180285251354054657,2019-10-05,00:55:07,repseanmaloney,7,20,62
