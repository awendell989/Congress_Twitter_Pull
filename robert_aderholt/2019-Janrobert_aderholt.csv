"In the rush to claim victory to deny initial funding for Border Security I wonder if the Democrats will remember their pledge to negotiate w/the White House to address what is a very real problem?

"For far too long, foreign countries have levied significantly higher tariffs on the U.S. ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ understands these types of acts are unjust.

"This morning, 214 Democrats denied furloughed DHS employees immediate pay. Democrats continue to use the suffering of our public servants as a political tool to keep them away from the negotiating table.

"Today, thousands of Americans joined together to mark the 46th anniversary of a terrible moment in American history – Roe V Wade. We mourn the loss of 60 million unborn children since 1973.
