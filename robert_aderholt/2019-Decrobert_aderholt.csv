"For over a year, @HouseGOP has asked Democrat leadership to put their politics aside and bring #USMCA to the floor. I'm glad they've finally brought this long-awaited deal up for a vote.

It's a great day for Alabama & I look forward to voting yes! #USMCANow",1207717840972926977,2019-12-19,17:42:26,robert_aderholt,0,0,2
"President Trump & @USTradeRep Lighthizer promised to re-balance & modernize the outdated NAFTA agreement with a high-standard trade deal. I applaud them in enhancing relations with two of our largest trade partners.

#USMCA is also estimated to increase U.S. production of automotive parts and employment in the sector. These are huge wins for two of Alabama's biggest industries.,1207717838414319618,2019-12-19,17:42:25,robert_aderholt,1,2,2

"I think George Bernard Shaw summed up what the Democrats impeachment will ultimately be for them: ""There are two tragedies in life. One is to lose your heart's desire.

I voted no on impeachment. It isn’t @realDonaldTrump  who has abused his power.  It is my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are abusing one of the most powerful tools entrusted to Congress in the Constitution for their own purposes. pic.twitter.com/LkvaLKe9Iq,1207472405536497664,2019-12-19,01:27:09,robert_aderholt,50,83,260
Grateful for the Trump administration and their commitment to lowering drug prices in the U.S. It's unfortunate that Democrat leadership chose to pursue partisan solutions over real solutions for the American people. https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1207309689781923841 …,1207406404467920896,2019-12-18,21:04:54,robert_aderholt,37,10,23
