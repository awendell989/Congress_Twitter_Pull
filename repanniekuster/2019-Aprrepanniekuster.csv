Our veterans put themselves on the line for our nation & sadly many of them & their families have been exposed to dangerous chemicals during their service. We’ve introduced the VETS PFAS Act to ensure that veterans and their families are able to get the care and support they need pic.twitter.com/cgg5tKqbAm,1113892917305851904,2019-04-04,19:55:41,repanniekuster,2,3,10
I’m encouraged the House voted to reauthorize the #ViolenceAgainstWomenAct today. I am proud to co-sponsor such important legislation - #VAWA19 will help prevent domestic and sexual violence crimes and provide the support survivors need to heal. pic.twitter.com/C5EpTtm4Yx,1113860570657304582,2019-04-04,17:47:09,repanniekuster,0,11,14
"51 years ago, our nation lost one of the greatest civil rights leaders ever known. Today as we celebrate the legacy of Dr. King, I fondly recall having the honor of hearing @RepJohnLewis share his account of the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery where he was joined by Dr. King. pic.twitter.com/RHMw4XzMxT",1113813616103428097,2019-04-04,14:40:34,repanniekuster,2,3,11
Today we voted to defend health protections for families in NH & nationwide. There is much we can do to improve the #ACA but we can't let the law be undermined & dismantled at the expense of the most vulnerable Americans. #ProtectOurCare #ForThePeople https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/03/house-trump-obamacare-1312041 …,1113558515627347968,2019-04-03,21:46:53,repanniekuster,5,6,23

"“I may be the first woman member of Congress, but I won’t be the last.” Today, we remember the words of #JeannetteRankin who was sworn in as the first female member of Congress on this day in 1917. 102 years and 365 female members later, we celebrate her legacy. pic.twitter.com/b9h6AOAXa5",1113157877131350021,2019-04-02,19:14:54,repanniekuster,1,3,20

It’s unacceptable women on average earn 80 cents to every dollar men earn. Women shouldn’t have to wait until today for their earnings to catch up to men’s earnings from 2018. We've made progress w/House passage of the #PaycheckFairnessAct but we must keep fighting. #EqualPayDay pic.twitter.com/Vt2v52V1BN,1113135580425195521,2019-04-02,17:46:18,repanniekuster,8,3,18
