They have never accepted the fact Donald Trump was elected president fair and square. House Democrats should be ashamed of themselves. #AL03 http://bit.ly/2oCYz0W ,1189927642201493504,2019-10-31,15:30:32,repmikerogersal,4,5,12
I'm proud to stand with President Trump and fight against the Democrats’ witch hunt. This sham is nothing more than an attempted coup. Adam Schiff’s investigation is based solely on lies and leaks.,1189927641295544321,2019-10-31,15:30:32,repmikerogersal,15,13,38

He's spent yrs lying to the American ppl abt President Trump all in a secret effort to try & undo the 2016 election.  It's ridiculous that House Democrats couldn’t even be bothered to hold an up or down vote on this resolution & instead resorted to procedural tricks to block it.,1186418372319293441,2019-10-21,23:05:57,repmikerogersal,21,69,118
