Held the first in a series of hearings today on domestic terrorism. Public policy should be designed to prevent as many of these tragedies as possible with limited resources and while operating within the bounds of constitutional government. https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/countering-domestic-terrorism-examining-the-evolving-threat …,1176969287845724163,2019-09-25,21:18:39,senronjohnson,173,4,32

Today is a full circle moment for Ramaih. I first met him and heard his story of transformation at the Wisconsin Resource Center in 2015. Today he got married in the same courtroom where he was sentenced 24 years ago. I hope his story will inspire others. https://twitter.com/js_newswatch/status/1174136471542009857 …,1174454328687566851,2019-09-18,22:45:06,senronjohnson,82,3,20
