Glad to see @POTUS responded to my call to end a failed Obamacare program that required every state to participate. The ironically-named “multi-state” program is only offered in 1 state + still costs taxpayers millions. A prime example of government waste. https://www.axios.com/trump-affordable-care-act-multi-state-plans-cfa730db-8110-4809-a915-8de8b6132201.html …,1123316696280961025,2019-04-30,20:02:25,senronjohnson,165,18,55

Our immigration laws are easy to exploit. Cartels have expanded into human trafficking and discovered that it is not only very profitable but entails less risk and less work. Congress must fix this.

Cartels are pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars ushering immigrants through Mexico. America’s broken immigration system—our laws and legal loopholes—sustains this wicked business model.
