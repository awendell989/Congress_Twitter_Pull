I commend @USACEHQ & @EPA for their continued commitment to finding a long-term flood control solution for the Yazoo Backwater Area.

#USMCA will benefit and grow the billions of dollars in trade Mississippi does with our North American neighbors.

I’m very happy the Appropriations Committee today approved U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement implementing legislation. Look forward to casting my vote to finalize the #USMCA this week.
