"Just voted to cancel President Trump's ""national emergency"" and block him from talking money from our military to fund his unnecessary border wall. Our servicemembers and their families should not be pawns in political fights, especially just to satisfy a campaign promise.",1177646181977075713,2019-09-27,18:08:24,repsusandavis,16,13,120

"It adds to a growing list of illegal acts abuse of power showing this President does not have either the capacity or the interest to follow the rule of law.

It is time to open an impeachment inquiry. To not move forward would make Congress complicit in the President's behavior.

I support community health centers and I stand with the 29 million patients that rely on on these organizations to provide affordable care to all.
