"Celebrated two extraordinary community leaders, Gracia Molina de Pick and Gus Chavez. Gus was a staunch advocate for Latino students empowering them and their families through education and Gracia was a fierce warrior for women’s rights.

Planned Parenthood is forced to withdraw from Title X rather than comply with the Trump Admin's dangerous gag rule. This could leave millions of women without healthcare services. I'll keep fighting this rule so patients don’t lose care. #StandWithPP https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/19/planned-parenthood-trump-administration-1468561 …,1163582224362627072,2019-08-19,22:43:15,repsusandavis,17,13,39

Two years ago Heather Heyer was killed in Charlottesville when a neo-Nazi drove his car into people protesting white supremacy and hatred. Let's honor her by never giving up the struggle against hate. pic.twitter.com/MGoTpMD9R1,1161027000657690625,2019-08-12,21:29:42,repsusandavis,8,8,38

"Every American deserves to have their voice heard. Despite enactment of the Voting Rights Act over 50 yrs ago, these rights continue to be eroded.

"It's not about video games. It's not about mental health. A white supremacist terrorist drove 9+ hours to El Paso to attack a historically safe, Hispanic community.

The House is doing its job and passed legislation (#HR8 & #HR1112) to end gun violence. It's time for the Senate to do its job and bring these bills to the Senate floor for a vote. #HonorWithAction,1158156368941113346,2019-08-04,23:22:50,repsusandavis,3,16,51
More families shattered by gun violence in Texas and Ohio - and less than a week after Gilroy. When will enough be enough? Our hearts go out to the victims and survivors and their families.
