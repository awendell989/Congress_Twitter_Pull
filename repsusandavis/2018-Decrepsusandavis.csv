Congratulations to Judge Sabraw for being selected as the San Diego Person of the Year. His commitment to upholding people's constitutional rights helped put an end to Trump's inhumane family separation policies. https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/editorials/sd-dana-sabraw-person-of-the-year-20181228-story.html?fbclid=IwAR3RHb4FEGqxTgx9qVWxz3crYY83Ocw1fu--YdWQf8DkPBtuMV632Tuqjuo …,1079789454007697413,2018-12-31,17:20:42,repsusandavis,3,13,46
Another child dies in custody. My condolences to the family who held out hope for a better life circumstance for their son.

Another victim of the #TrumpShutdown is the Violence Against Women Act. Trump needs to let Congress reopen the government so women can continue to access these critical resources. https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/violence-against-women-act-to-expire-with-government-shutdown/2018/12/21/b66f600a-0557-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html?fbclid=IwAR3hXFA_BxeuvS0jBEUSMxZQXj1NkuW4nG6pkrJgKE0-uZu_FXAvgD4Mj-0&utm_term=.6b1fa2cfff0b …,1077264140245164035,2018-12-24,18:06:00,repsusandavis,5,5,16
Someone who says they care about national security doesn't force federal law enforcement officers to work without pay. Trump needs to let Congress reopen the government. #TrumpShutdown pic.twitter.com/3ctXibG6xl,1076873858429333504,2018-12-23,16:15:09,repsusandavis,17,11,53

The #TrumpShutdown will only hurt people and San Diego’s economy. I voted against border wall funding in the House and it will be voted down in the Senate. The GOP controls all levers of government and has the responsibility to govern responsibly. #NoBorderWall pic.twitter.com/IbefNio6w5,1076218644340842496,2018-12-21,20:51:34,repsusandavis,11,8,49
Federal criminal justice reform is long overdue. Glad to have joined my colleagues in voting for the bipartisan First Step Act.
