This not only impacts our military but jobs and our local economy. He couldn't get Mexico to pay for his wall. He couldn't get Congress to pay for it. Now he's forcing our men and women in uniform to pay for it. https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/sd-me-trump-military-projects-20190227-story.html …,1101167198775767040,2019-02-28,17:08:13,repsusandavis,10,7,23
"After years of inaction Congress is finally moving to #EndGunViolence. Today we are offering more than thoughts and prayers.

A bipartisan House voted to uphold the Constitution and end President Trump’s national emergency declaration to fund his border wall. Trump is attempting to bypass Congress and raid funding from our military and military families. https://susandavis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=393049&fbclid=IwAR2cYBmMDvmiudziK3kc4T1nEC_CmVShyWV1Xq6pVQDKiIHD5P4opHWQ_hA …,1100617425748484096,2019-02-27,04:43:37,repsusandavis,4,6,36
In some countries the most important building is the school. Investing in America’s future generations starts with a commitment to our schools being the most important buildings in our country. I am happy to support the Rebuild America Schools Act to make that happen. pic.twitter.com/JzPUdXjgMd,1100534700660178944,2019-02-26,23:14:54,repsusandavis,3,5,24
"Ready to mark up #HR1 in committee. I’ll fight any attempts to weaken this key measure. It will increase access to the ballot box, end gerrymandering, and limit the influence of big money in politics. #ForThePeople pic.twitter.com/DmvQXiCLA4",1100495901200666624,2019-02-26,20:40:43,repsusandavis,1,2,19
"I'm joining my colleagues to block the #FakeTumpEmergency. The Constitution explicitly gives Congress the power of the purse.
