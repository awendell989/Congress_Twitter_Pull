A sign of progress. San Diego is a leader in solar energy. We must build on this success. The House will move to block President Trump from withdrawing us from the Paris Agreement & direct him to create a plan to meet the agreement's goals. #ActOnClimate https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/29/business/renewable-energy-coal-solar/index.htmlÂ â€¦,1123306294839074817,2019-04-30,19:21:05,repsusandavis,3,6,22

"Despite the Attorney Generalâ€™s spin job, the report is a far cry from what he described. It's a call for Congress to take a closer look, which should start with Robert Muellerâ€™s testimony before Congress.

I was proud to be in the fight to repeal Donâ€™t Ask Donâ€™t Tell and Iâ€™m proud to work on taking down the #TransMilitaryBan. The ban on transgender troops is not based on science or readiness.
