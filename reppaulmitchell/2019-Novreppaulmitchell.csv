I urge Speaker Pelosi to get back to doing the people’s work and bring #USMCA to the floor for a vote this year. #USMCAnow https://thehill.com/policy/finance/471500-pelosi-casts-doubt-on-usmca-deal-in-2019 …,1197879999962980356,2019-11-22,14:10:22,reppaulmitchell,85,116,411
"Just last week, Speaker Pelosi said that passing #USMCA before year’s end was “imminent”, and now she’s backtracking. USMCA will drive export growth, boost American small businesses, and increase market access for American goods.
