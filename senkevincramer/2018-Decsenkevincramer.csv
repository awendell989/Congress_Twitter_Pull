I intend to work with my colleagues about hearing and passing it in the remaining hours of the 115th Congress.

I appreciate the passion of many constituents on this important issue.

Judge’s decision to declare #Obamacare unconstitutional presents an opportunity for our divided government to pass #healthcare reform to protect people with #PreExistingConditions & lower health care costs.

The integrity of the supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (#SNAP) is significantly strengthened with 30 improvements in the new #FARMBILL.  It increases training opportunities for recipients and helps move them toward self-sufficiency. pic.twitter.com/i6tE4J5Hay,1073669104391897089,2018-12-14,20:00:36,senkevincramer,3,2,4
We’ve worked long and hard for this big win for ND.  New #FARMBILL removes industrial #hemp from regulation as a controlled substance & legalizes it as an agricultural commodity. It makes it eligible for crop insurance and mandates a streamlined process for developing policies. pic.twitter.com/cVdSyXV0Zs,1073660976367583232,2018-12-14,19:28:19,senkevincramer,3,3,13
A priority for North Dakota #sugarbeet producers is the new #FARMBILL maintain the no-cost sugar program. I’m pleased this had wide support in Congress.  Another win directs the FDA to not require added sugars declarations for single ingredient foods like sugar and honey. pic.twitter.com/Jdqtwp7UPc,1073652625449586688,2018-12-14,18:55:08,senkevincramer,0,4,15
"The new #FARMBILL increases limits on loan guarantees, and farm ownership and operating loan programs. These new limits better represent the true cost of contemporary agriculture and will help producers buy, build and maintain new or existing farms and ranches. pic.twitter.com/Pxm20OY5dO",1073645787807182848,2018-12-14,18:27:57,senkevincramer,2,1,2
The new #FARMBILL establishes a common-sense vegetation management pilot program I introduced as a stand-alone bill for federal forest land. This lets utilities do their job to secure the right of way for major transmission lines and helps prevent fires. pic.twitter.com/NyfztyfYFD,1073640316752797696,2018-12-14,18:06:13,senkevincramer,1,4,4
I heard from many ND producers on including language in the new #FARMBILL to prevent and respond to emerging animal diseases. It reauthorizes the National Animal Health Laboratory Network for rapid disease diagnosis & establishes a U.S.-only vaccine bank to respond to threats. pic.twitter.com/4jun1cPLpz,1073633241373048832,2018-12-14,17:38:06,senkevincramer,0,2,3
#FARMBILL fixes Agriculture Risk Coverage payment rates requested by Logan and LaMoure county corn growers and is based on my stand-alone bill.
