I’ve been very disturbed by Saudi Arabia’s actions: from the humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  I’ve previously voted to end support for Saudi-led coalition in Yemen—and am cosponsoring @SenSanders’ effort for today's vote https://wapo.st/2FKUmA6 ,1067861176342769665,2018-11-28,19:21:58,sengarypeters,77,358,1452

I held a subcommittee field summit on #PFAS exposure Tuesday in Grand Rapids to help inform actions the federal government must take to address this crisis. See some of the highlights via @FOX17: http://bit.ly/2K6lub4 ,1063445600988012545,2018-11-16,14:56:03,sengarypeters,6,14,39
That’s why I’m glad the Senate passed my provision to establish a Center of Expertise for Great Lakes oil spill response. This is an important step in ensuring we are better prepared to protect our resources for future generations. http://bit.ly/2FnNSGV ,1063163442641715201,2018-11-15,20:14:52,sengarypeters,7,19,72
Last year the Coast Guard Commandant told me they were not prepared for an oil spill in the #GreatLakes & that more research must be done. That’s incredibly alarming—40 million people rely on the Great Lakes for safe drinking water.,1063163389927661570,2018-11-15,20:14:39,sengarypeters,13,32,150

It’s more important than ever that Congress take action to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation.
