Serving the people of the Volunteer State in the Senate has been the greatest privilege of my life. I thank Tennesseans for the opportunity and am happy to congratulate Senator @MarshaBlackburn on being sworn in today. I will be cheering her on each step of the way. pic.twitter.com/hJTWeZJANG,1080875454263902213,2019-01-03,17:16:04,senbobcorker,690,111,1450
