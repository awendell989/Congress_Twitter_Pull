"This is how extreme on abortion some on the radical left have become. This is disgusting. That’s why I am calling for a vote on the House Floor to #EndInfanticide. It’s clear that now more than ever, the most innocent form of life needs protection. https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1123727511987396609 …",1123753154372427776,2019-05-02,00:56:44,stevescalise,362,1423,3032
Democrats claim the #GreenNewDeal is a top priority—but Pelosi won’t allow a vote on it because she knows it's out of step with most Americans & is full of extremist policies. Republicans are pushing for a vote because you deserve to know if your Rep supports this radical scheme. pic.twitter.com/OcONuNViSF,1123683003442581504,2019-05-01,20:17:59,stevescalise,27,84,245
"The American energy industry is firing on all cylinders. Wages are up, GDP growth is strong, the job market is booming, and emissions are down. But the left wants to reverse this success with their radical #GreenNewDeal.

"Across America, even more & more DEMOCRATS (up 17% since January) are concerned about the illegal immigration crisis, but House Dems refuse to acknowledge it. They need to listen to the American people: We need a wall to stop the flow of deadly drugs & criminals into our country. pic.twitter.com/a2QB6mkrv8",1123588699084787718,2019-05-01,14:03:15,stevescalise,56,421,1423
"Instead of dangerous proposals like the #GreenNewDeal that would outsource energy production & manufacturing to nations that lack environmental safeguards, we should focus on using all forms of U.S. energy sources to cut costs for families & create jobs. https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/441526-green-new-deals-centralized-government-approach-wont?rnd=1556712554 …",1123573465804677122,2019-05-01,13:02:43,stevescalise,71,161,527

"Illegal immigrants won’t stop pouring into America until we fully enforce our immigration laws. Right now, they know they’ll be set free after turning themselves in to CBP agents.

"Democrats can't keep denying there's a crisis at our border → Cartels are charging adults & children up to $9,000/person to be smuggled into America, and they're using the profits to fund dangerous drug & human trafficking operations.
