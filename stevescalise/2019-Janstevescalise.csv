- Refuse to secure our border and protect our country from criminals and drugs
- NOW eliminate a crucial committee to investigate terrorism and replace it with one to continue their political harassment of @realDonaldTrump https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-foreign-affairs-committee-chairman-engel-seeks-to-replace-terrorism-panel-with-one-to-probe-trump …",1083842111768797184,2019-01-11,21:44:30,stevescalise,545,1716,2732
