"After 22 months and tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, the Mueller probe is finally over.

No collusion. No obstruction.

The narrative that Democrats and the mainstream media have pushed relentlessly for almost two years has proven false. It's time to move on.",1109945837499699201,2019-03-24,22:31:24,repclayhiggins,25,20,89

There's nothing unconstitutional about restoring a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. Census. The question we should be asking is why my Democratic colleagues are so opposed to knowing how many non-citizens are in our country. pic.twitter.com/GH5GyiV1Hb,1106292607787896832,2019-03-14,20:34:46,repclayhiggins,91,348,559

Law enforcement professionals tasked with securing our borders don't need DC bureaucrats or politicians to tell them what their mission is. All they need is for Congress to provide the resources that they have clearly and properly requested. pic.twitter.com/hzxX9qxci6,1103733321346007045,2019-03-07,19:05:04,repclayhiggins,38,77,174
