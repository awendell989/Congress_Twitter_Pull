"Ecuadorian President Moreno was right to revoke asylum for Julian Assange. This is not a case of 1st Amendment rights, but of collusion with Chelsea Manning (real collusion, not the false Trump-Russia narrative) to obtain classified data from the U.S. government.",1116751689250430977,2019-04-12,17:15:25,reprooney,2,1,6
Attempting to infiltrate sensitive gov’t computer networks & illegally obtain classified information is not protected by the 1st Amendment right to free speech.

"On 9/11, Islamic terrorists killed 2,996 people on American soil. Rep. Omar referring to this act of terror as ""some people did something"" is offensive to me & to the victims who lost their lives that day, and is just the latest in a series of disturbing comments from this rep.",1115953408907857921,2019-04-10,12:23:20,reprooney,4,4,18
"The Eastern Gulf of Mexico is home to the Gulf Test Range, 120,000 square miles that stretch from the Florida panhandle to the Keys.

Offshore drilling would undermine our tourism and recreation-based economy. Any repeat of the BP oil spill disaster would devastate our multi-billion dollar tourist-based economy.

This morning I testified at the House Natural Resources Committee on the importance of preventing offshore drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.
