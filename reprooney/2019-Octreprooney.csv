The United States and the international community must condemn the irregularities observed by the #OAS in #Bolivia’s presidential election. I urge the #Morales government to respect the will of the Bolivian people. https://www.foxnews.com/world/bolivia-evo-morales-rioting-vote-count …,1187053796414885888,2019-10-23,17:10:54,reprooney,22,6,15

I urge the Morales government to uphold democratic principles ahead of Sunday’s general elections in #Bolivia and respect the will of the Bolivian people in determining the future of their country https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2546 …,1185258021590618113,2019-10-18,18:15:08,reprooney,70,16,58
I welcome the announcement by @StateDept to resume aid to the Northern Triangle. It is essential to combatting the root causes of the migrant crisis that has overwhelmed our southern border and improving millions of lives in the region. https://twitter.com/statedeptspox/status/1184565270779748357 …,1184890827488845825,2019-10-17,17:56:02,reprooney,45,16,59
"The corrupt, authoritarian #Maduro regime is one of the world's most egregious violators of #humanrights. #Venezuela winning a seat on the Human Rights Council further damages any remaining credibility of the @UNHRC. https://twitter.com/UNWatch/status/1184859222015664128 …",1184887136153227264,2019-10-17,17:41:22,reprooney,39,15,93
The decision by @realdonaldtrump to withdraw our troops from Syria has made way for a Turkish offensive on the Syrian Kurds and will do lasting harm. I strongly urge @realdonaldtrump to immediately reverse his decision and support the Kurds https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-joint-resolution/77?s=2&r=1 …,1184804387396431872,2019-10-17,12:12:33,reprooney,107,49,278
I cosponsored this piece of legislation to send a strong message to Turkey to end their military offensive against the friendly Syrian Kurds. We must not risk an ISIS resurgence and a regaining influence from our adversaries. https://twitter.com/RepLizCheney/status/1184513950664278016 …,1184801127692460032,2019-10-17,11:59:36,reprooney,19,18,90
"Our plan of withdrawal from Syria has invited an invasion by Turkey which is guaranteed to create many additional Syrian and Kurdish refugees. Reports are coming in that hundreds of Syrians have fled to Iraq where @Kurdistan has already accepted over 200,000 refugees from #Syria https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1183631022971338752 …",1184157869979164672,2019-10-15,17:23:31,reprooney,31,111,257

The recent occurrence of violence in #Ecuador is disturbing; the United States should openly support democratic actors there and the @Lenin Moreno government’s efforts to resolve this crisis peacefully.,1181937710992445441,2019-10-09,14:21:24,reprooney,8,1,10
Medvedev’s trip to #Cuba and Borisov’s trip to #Venezuela highlights #Russia’s continued support for dictators and human rights abusers in the region. The U.S. must continue to stand against Russia’s malign influence and stand for #Democracy. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-venezuela/russian-deputy-prime-minister-in-venezuela-to-support-maduro-idUSKCN1WK0CF …,1181290258983477253,2019-10-07,19:28:39,reprooney,7,7,19
"As this letter makes clear, the hearing process today undermines the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on which I sit. Further, by limiting questions and input from all sides of the inquiry the process is asymmetrically oriented to express only some points of view. https://twitter.com/HouseForeignGOP/status/1179563969796874240 …",1179764062017720320,2019-10-03,14:24:05,reprooney,49,127,209
"ICYMI: Last week I met with Nicaragua’s opposition leaders @AlianzaCivicaNi and #UNAB and heard about their struggle against the murderous Ortega regime.
