Agencies like the IRS & Social Security will very rarely call you without sending letters in the mail first. I urge you to warn your loved ones about these deceptive techniques.

Association Health Plans are a great option for sparsely populated states like Wyoming. That’s one of the reasons I intro'd a bill today to cement a @USDOL rule allowing businesses to pool together for health care coverage. https://www.greenriverstar.com/story/2019/04/10/opinion/our-view-enzis-plan-was-promising/6045.html …,1116440219346186248,2019-04-11,20:37:45,senatorenzi,0,2,3
