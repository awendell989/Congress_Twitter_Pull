Wyoming is proud to be home to many family-owned businesses. This #SmallBusinessSaturday remember to stop by your local shops – as some of the best gifts come from local artists and retailers.

Supporting temporary positions means filling the gaps in our economy – and further supporting jobs that Americans already hold. https://www.enzi.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=C99506A0-FE39-4C64-BFB0-63C4AD9B42C2 …,1196916910446850048,2019-11-19,22:23:23,senatorenzi,7,3,4
"While America is experiencing record-low unemployment, this puts a strain on seasonal and tourist businesses due to the low number of available temporary workers.

The right approach to tobacco policy is to get people to stop smoking or – better yet – to never start. We need to know how the Tobacco Control Act is working and be responsive to new technologies and potential threats to our children and the public health.,1194738415293665280,2019-11-13,22:06:50,senatorenzi,11,3,9

I’m pleased the government affairs committee passed @RandPaul's Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act. This bill incentivizes employees to find and eliminate waste in the government’s spending rather than promoting the status quo “use it or lose it” mentality.  https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/senate-committee-passes-dr-rand-paul%E2%80%99s-bonuses-cost-cutters-act …,1192227412186030080,2019-11-06,23:49:00,senatorenzi,20,5,23

The current budget process is broken and the American people deserve better. I wrote an opinion article with @senwhitehouse explaining how our historic legislation would take a needed and important step toward restoring the broken budget process.  http://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/unglamorous-job-federal-budgeting … pic.twitter.com/Jb1UUr8sET,1191846195632726016,2019-11-05,22:34:11,senatorenzi,9,7,12
