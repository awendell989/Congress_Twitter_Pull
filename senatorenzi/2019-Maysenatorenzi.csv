"Today we come together as a nation to honor the memory of those who gave their lives in the service of our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to fully repay.

We are not benefiting from cheaper prescription drug alternatives like biosimilars as much as we should. Biosimilars are one of the ways we can do something about health care costs without just shifting them elsewhere in the system or implementing administrative price controls.,1131645689727991808,2019-05-23,19:38:52,senatorenzi,5,5,5
