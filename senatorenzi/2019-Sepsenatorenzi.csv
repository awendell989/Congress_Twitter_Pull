I spent a wonderful Saturday at Hero Appreciation Day in Rock Springs honoring our Wyoming military and first responders. They are not only heroes for their service but also for their commitment to our communities. It was great to see how Sweetwater County shows its appreciation. pic.twitter.com/V4G2F8xN1q,1176603549385601027,2019-09-24,21:05:21,senatorenzi,6,3,5
Wyoming recognizes trailblazing folks by honoring them in the Wyoming Cowboy Hall of Fame. This organization works to preserve the important cowboy and ranching history of our state.

"I’m glad FDA is taking steps to advance awareness & education of biosimilars – an idea like the one included in my bipartisan bill.

I’m glad the House introduced companion legislation to my biosimilars education bill with @SenatorHassan.
