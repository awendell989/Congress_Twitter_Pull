"Contrary to some outdated reports, I cosponsored @LindseyGrahamSC's resolution.

Diana and I were honored to be part of the Marshall Legacy Institute’s Clearing the Path event this week.

The House-passed multiemployer pension bailout bill would hold the majority of Americans who are NOT on these plans responsible for bailing out the small number who are.
