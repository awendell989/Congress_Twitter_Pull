Biologists agree that the Yellowstone population of grizzly bears has recovered and might have even reached capacity in many areas of the ecosystem. I am committed to working with the Administration to delist these bears and give Wyoming proper authority to manage its wildlife.,1156275947827539968,2019-07-30,18:50:43,senatorenzi,5,4,12
It is extremely disappointing that grizzly bears in the Yellowstone region will be added back to the endangered species list due to a frivolous lawsuit and a flawed court decision. https://bit.ly/2Yeyy8z ,1156275946258874368,2019-07-30,18:50:42,senatorenzi,7,1,9
