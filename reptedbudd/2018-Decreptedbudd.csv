Tonight we took the first step in securing our Southern Border by funding President Trump’s wall.  I hope the Senate will follow suit so that we can deliver on a promise that has been made to the American people.,1075934710927376384,2018-12-21,02:03:19,reptedbudd,52,26,100
"There are those that wish to secure our Southern Border with a wall and there are those who, for mostly political reasons, would rather see the government shut down than do any such thing.  Please know that I will be making this case until the very end.",1075753713564815361,2018-12-20,14:04:06,reptedbudd,26,39,174
"If we are not willing to fight for a border wall now, do we really expect there to be a better opportunity when Nancy Pelosi is in power?  Now is the time for us to draw a line in the sand and make a very clear contrast.",1075753711325069312,2018-12-20,14:04:05,reptedbudd,10,57,212
"The fact that we are even considering a bill with zero dollars for the border wall is nothing short of a complete surrender and it is my hope that President Trump will refuse to sign it.  Republicans have control of the House for 14 more days, but we sure aren’t acting like it.",1075753709865484291,2018-12-20,14:04:05,reptedbudd,19,92,263
"I wanted let you know where I am on the government funding bill the House will be voting on later today:

1 - I will be voting against it. 

2 - I am encouraging President Trump to veto it if it passes.",1075753706631630850,2018-12-20,14:04:04,reptedbudd,163,429,1466
