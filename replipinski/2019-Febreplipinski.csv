"On Thurs, the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, which I serve on as Rail Subcommittee chairman, will hold a hearing on the cost of doing nothing and why investing in our trillion-dollar infrastructure backlog cannot wait. #sotu",1092981126942150656,2019-02-06,02:59:41,replipinski,0,0,4
"I appreciate #potus calling on Congress to produce an infrastructure package that invests in vital national projects. However, we need more than lip service. We need funding so we can ease congestion on roads, improve public transportation, & fix crumbling infrastructure. #sotu",1092980553169686529,2019-02-06,02:57:25,replipinski,2,2,13
"Both parties in Congress SHOULD be working for effective, nonpartisan oversight and investigations. That hasn’t been happening, but that’s the way our government is supposed to work. Checks and balances. #sotu",1092976915072405506,2019-02-06,02:42:57,replipinski,0,2,13
If only the president would follow his grandiose words with action working together for the American people. #sotu,1092974160098349064,2019-02-06,02:32:00,replipinski,6,1,23
Hanging out in the House gallery with my #sotu guest CPD Officer Gino Garcia. Gino’s seat is on the aisle in the exact middle of the gallery directly facing the president. pic.twitter.com/YjR88l3W3U,1092961628021092352,2019-02-06,01:42:13,replipinski,3,2,8
Today’s @EPA data shows that the EtO levels around the Sterigenics facilities in Willowbrook are well over the EPA action threshold for cancer risk. One result was 350 times the threshold. It is time for EPA to immediately shut the facilities down. pic.twitter.com/rIVL7ofp7Z,1092920134812008448,2019-02-05,22:57:20,replipinski,5,13,28
My #SOTU guest tomorrow is @Chicago_Police officer Gino Garcia. Gino was 6 when domestic violence tragically ended his mother’s life. The experience made him the man he is today: an advocate for victims & an upstanding public servant. #enddomesticviolence https://news.wttw.com/2019/02/01/chicago-police-officer-gino-garcia-invited-attend-state-union …,1092630871658688512,2019-02-05,03:47:54,replipinski,2,1,7
I base this call on the air testing EPA has already conducted and made this clear to Sterigenics executives when we met last week.,1092570797691076611,2019-02-04,23:49:11,replipinski,0,1,6
"This story makes several allegations that, if confirmed, are incredibly disturbing. I will continue to hold @Sterigenics1 accountable and will not relent in calling for the @EPA to shut down the plant unless they can prove that it is not a health threat. https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/02/03/sterigenics-covered-up-toxic-emissions-operated-secret-plants/ …",1092570585354461184,2019-02-04,23:48:21,replipinski,4,6,21

"Been a long time since I did karaoke, but had so much fun doing it last week for a good cause. Though I think I’ll keep my day job.
