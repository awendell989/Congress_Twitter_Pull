Thanks for having me speak at the annual @ACECIllinois Engineering Excellence Awards. Always a pleasure speaking to my fellow engineers. I’m hopeful we’ll get an infrastructure bill in Congress and make this a great year for engineering projects. pic.twitter.com/L5bIQAb9l0,1102021645542273025,2019-03-03,01:43:29,replipinski,2,4,27
Talked to @cbschicago about the @Amtrak system failure at Union Station this week. I’ll be meeting with CEO Anderson to oversee the action plans they are putting in place to make sure this doesn’t happen again. https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/03/01/worker-on-circuit-breaker-caused-chaos-at-union-station/ …,1101911725333454848,2019-03-02,18:26:42,replipinski,3,0,2
.@Amtrak's apology for the unacceptable problems they caused for @Metra passengers yesterday is only a start. There are many questions Amtrak needs to answer and then fixes need to be made as soon as possible.  I have called CEO Anderson to my office for another meeting next week pic.twitter.com/9jaB0nk9jx,1101619929709768704,2019-03-01,23:07:13,replipinski,6,2,24
The Senate approved @EPA chief Wheeler today. I wrote to him this week telling him he should use his authority under the Clean Air Act to protect the public from endangerment resulting from @sterigenics1's EtO emissions. Citizens need to be protected if Sterigenics wins in court.,1101315388913184768,2019-03-01,02:57:04,replipinski,2,10,30
