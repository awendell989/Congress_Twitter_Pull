I voted NO on the sham impeachment inquiry. @HouseDemocrats don’t accept the results of the 2016 election and are blinded by hatred of @realDonaldTrump. It’s time for @SpeakerPelosi and the Dems to put country before party. Let’s work for the American People. They deserve it.,1190629634980941824,2019-11-02,14:00:00,reptomrice,25,7,34
