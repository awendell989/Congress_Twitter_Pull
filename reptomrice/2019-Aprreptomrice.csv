Why Dems would place partisan politics over a bipartisan reauthorization of VAWA is beyond me. It is my hope that we can work together on a bipartisan reauthorization of VAWA that reflects the true intent of this legislation and protects women & children from domestic violence.,1113869879659106304,2019-04-04,18:24:08,reptomrice,4,0,1
