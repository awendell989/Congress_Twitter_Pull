"I applaud @AFLCIO for opposing @RepAOC's disastrous #GreenNewDeal proposal. Thousands of their members (mostly Democrats) would lose their jobs under the GND, with no plan in place for them afterwards.

".@SenSanders stated that all convicted felons, including the “Boston Bomber” Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, should be allowed to vote in US elections WHILE IN PRISON.

Today marks 20 yrs since the tragic shooting occurred at Columbine H.S. It’s been 2 decades & we still aren’t doing enough to identify those who are moving along the pathway toward committing an act of violence. I have a solution.

"Mueller Report certifies what @VP, @POTUS & most ppl have said all along: NO COLLUSION. Far too much time/money has been wasted chasing this hoax & I’m glad it’s over.

"During the Dems first 100 days, we've seen them embrace socialism, enable anti-Semitism, stand by infanticide, support open borders, infringe on 2nd Amend, harass @POTUS & more.

My I-14 bill furthers Pres. Eisenhower's vision of an interstate system that connects US military assets & cities across America.

.@housesciencegop held a great hearing with NASA Admin @JimBridenstine to discuss NASA’s budget. @POTUS has declared @NASA will land US astronauts on the Moon by 2024.

Hope @POTUS doesn’t have to close southern border but if that’s what it takes to secure & preserve the US & its people - I fully support him. How long can a country remain sovereign w/o borders?
