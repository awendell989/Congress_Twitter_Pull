"What if a bipartisan solution existed to stop mass targeted violence before it struck?

"I applaud EPA’s decision to repeal Obama's Waters of the US rule. This pure power grab vastly expanded federal regulatory authority by qualifying almost every puddle of water in the country, even seasonal ponds and ditches, as “navigable waters”.
