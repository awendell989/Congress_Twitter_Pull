"Students, parents, and educators - mark your calendars and join me and @TXRandy14 as we host a U.S Service Academy and ROTC Forum on Saturday, September 14! pic.twitter.com/60HEuSJO6H",1167529162388779008,2019-08-30,20:06:58,repbrianbabin,3,3,11
I'm so glad that I was able to stop and visit with my good friend Logan Archer yesterday at the Special Angels Rodeo in Orange. There were many wonderful folks freely giving their time to make sure the event was a success. The hearts of volunteers are always special!  #TX36 pic.twitter.com/B1sERSEC5w,1164660812771991553,2019-08-22,22:09:10,repbrianbabin,2,0,4
The Flores ruling’s been used to exploit minors at our southern border for years. This loophole must be fixed if our immigration system’s ever going to be trusted again. @DHSgov will now have the time needed to fairly process families & provide proper care. https://bit.ly/31ToS0D ,1164286416999919616,2019-08-21,21:21:27,repbrianbabin,9,2,12
I enjoyed visiting with Hardin County Judge Wayne McDaniel earlier today while viewing their newly remodeled court room. It looks fantastic! #TX36 pic.twitter.com/hU9pQ50OtL,1163920961114169344,2019-08-20,21:09:16,repbrianbabin,5,0,8
Our police officers should NEVER have to worry about this. Last night's shootout lasted 8+ hours & resulted in six officers being wounded – you would think the crowd surrounding the scene would show more support. The actions of those involved are shameful. https://fxn.ws/2NbOuBI ,1162107733723754518,2019-08-15,21:04:09,repbrianbabin,8,4,13
Proud to join my colleagues in commemorating the 35th anniversary of the Mexico City policy. American taxpayer dollars should NEVER fund international abortions. Pres. Reagan believed this & so do I. Congress should take action to make this policy law NOW. https://bit.ly/2YWy7zz ,1161712839142400000,2019-08-14,18:54:59,repbrianbabin,7,2,4
I applaud @DHSgov's rule ensuring aliens seeking to live in the US have the skills/capabilities to support themselves. Illegal aliens have burdened US taxpayers for too long. @realDonaldTrump is doing is part - when will D's allow Congress to do the same? https://fxn.ws/2YKF1Ze ,1161340009154318337,2019-08-13,18:13:29,repbrianbabin,7,3,11
".@jasonsdeli has been a Babin family restaurant of choice for a long time. The amount of their soft serve ice cream I’ve consumed over the years is probably best left unsaid.

"Why are we STILL discussing the Mueller Report? Good bills are just sitting in @HouseJudiciary waiting to be addressed, while we continue to waste time on an investigation that’s long been ended.

"I joined @FoxFriendsFirst to discuss the tragedies that occurred in El Paso/Dayton and how Congress NEEDS to come together to end this kind of targeted violence. Many folks are offering ideas, but no bill has the overwhelming bipartisan support that the TAPS Act has. #PassTAPS pic.twitter.com/XyAfWGXgPy",1158837975230361600,2019-08-06,20:31:18,repbrianbabin,85,46,115
