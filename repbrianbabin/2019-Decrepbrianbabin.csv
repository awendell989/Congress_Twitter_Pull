If you haven’t taken the time to read this letter – do so. @realDonaldTrump highlights every lie and fraudulent claim behind House Democrats’ articles of impeachment.

The American people elected @realDonaldTrump to the third EQUAL branch of government. The House majority's voting to impeach @POTUS based on HATRED – nothing else. They don't like the decision made by 63M voters & will do ANYTHING to prevent them from voting the same way in 2020.,1207306711255699457,2019-12-18,14:28:45,repbrianbabin,177,256,705

Bipartisanship continues to be traded for political games. Heavy-handed government interventions like Speaker Pelosi’s #HR3 will cost American patients access to lifesaving drugs and halt innovation.

Democrats forget: The President does not serve at the pleasure of the U.S. Congress. He serves at the pleasure of the American people & that’s what he's doing.
