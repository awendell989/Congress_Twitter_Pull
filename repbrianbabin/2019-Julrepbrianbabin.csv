".@HouseDemocrats have spent 7 months pushing policies that set the nation back, increase government control & make life harder for Americans.

The House @JudiciaryGOP & Intel Comm Mueller hearings provided the same result that we knew before â€“ no collusion between @realDonaldTrump & Russia.

"The border crisis will not end until Congress secures the southern border, closes loopholes & allows @ICEgov to deport aliens w/ removal papers.

"Let me get this straight, not only are Dems wasting time on a Mueller hearing in general, but on a make-believe one too?!

"The Left's ongoing attack on Israel is shameful but not surprising. Boycotting Israel is like boycotting Nazi Germany? Absurd. Will the Dem majority ever stand up against anti-Semitism?

America's a nation of laws. We cannot just ignore the laws we donâ€™t like and enforce the ones we do. The immigration laws that @realDonaldTrump's trying to implement are the same laws that many House Dems voted in favor of in past years.

Iâ€™m glad @realDonaldTrump is ready to hold Iran liable for its actions. This tyrannical regime has officially broken Obamaâ€™s 2015 nuclear deal â€“ big surprise â€“ by surpassing uranium limits.
