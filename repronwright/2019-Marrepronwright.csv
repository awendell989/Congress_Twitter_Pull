My friend and colleague  @Lancegooden asked for unanimous consent so that we could vote on infanticide! The Dems continue to say no and refuse to go on the record against killing infants that are born alive. I heartily concur with his comments! #prolife https://www.lifenews.com/2019/03/28/house-democrats-block-bill-to-stop-infanticide-for-22nd-time-refuse-care-for-aborted-babies-born-alive/ …,1111264889920737280,2019-03-28,13:52:50,repronwright,0,7,8
