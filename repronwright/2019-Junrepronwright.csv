Seems logical that if you are conducting a census you would ask if the person was a citizen of the country. Mind blowing that #SCOTUS rules against it. https://twitter.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1144290773288046592¬†‚Ä¶,1144335990544318465,2019-06-27,20:05:35,repronwright,6,1,3
Why are House Democrats and Nancy Pelosi trying to stop humanitarian aid to our border? They have argued that this is exactly what is needed but now that it comes time to act they stall and obstruct the process! This is an outrage!  #HumanitarianCrisis,1144324242328174605,2019-06-27,19:18:54,repronwright,5,0,11

It is way past time for Dems to deal with the humanitarian crisis on our southern border. Just this week I joined several of my colleagues in asking Speaker Pelosi to work with us to end the border crisis now.
