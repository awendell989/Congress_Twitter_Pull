"Americans arenâ€™t fooled by @SpeakerPelosiâ€™s continuing sham impeachment. Just more political games. Instead of working on behalf of the People, her impeachment agenda continues.

".@SpeakerPelosi is trying to score a win with the media, but the people who are really hurt by this stunt are our men and women in uniform overseas and their families.

The War Powers resolution is ill-timed and reckless political theatre from @SpeakerPelosi with the sole purpose of undermining Commander-in-Chief @realDonaldTrump.

America is safer without Qasem Soleimani.
