Had a productive conversation with Harman Mayor Jerry Teter today.  He gave me an update and I reassured him that my office is going to be a resource to the Town through this process. Prayers are appreciated for all involved. https://www.wdtv.com/content/news/Harman-recovering-from-flash-floods-512079432.html …,1146126016487788547,2019-07-02,18:38:30,repalexmooney,1,2,6,2019-07-02 18:38:30
