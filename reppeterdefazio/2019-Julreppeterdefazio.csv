The House has finally passed a much-needed reform to the Affordable Care Act: a repeal of the #CadillacTax. I was opposed to its inclusion in the ACA and have supported its repeal ever since. This 40% tax on employer-sponsored plans puts an unfair burden on middle class families.,1151943529704382464,2019-07-18,19:55:14,reppeterdefazio,5,5,25

"I've criticized our relationship with Saudi Arabia for decades, but Trump has taken this relationship to a new extreme & cozied up to a ruler who was involved in the murder of US resident Jamal Khashoggi.

"Now more than ever, Congress needs to reassert its constitutional authority and act as a check on Trump's war-making powers.
