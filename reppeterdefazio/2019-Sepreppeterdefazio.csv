"Proud to lead debate today to end the reckless border wall emergency declaration. The president said Mexico would pay. Instead, he is stealing funds from our Armed Forces, FEMA, and TSA to pay for a wall that won’t work. https://bit.ly/2nQ1SRu ",1177662427200143360,2019-09-27,19:12:57,reppeterdefazio,26,22,117
The UN @IPCC_CH report on our oceans is alarming: especially ocean heat waves like the “the blob” that wreaked havoc from Hawaii to Alaska. Oregon’s coastal communities and economy are at risk. We must act swiftly before it’s too late. #OceanClimateAction  http://buff.ly/2lrzCnF ,1177351786862129154,2019-09-26,22:38:34,reppeterdefazio,1,8,24
"Finally, the House passed with my support #SAFEBankingAct, landmark legislation to ensure that legal cannabis and hemp businesses in OR and across the country have access to banking services.

Blackmailing a foreign leader by withholding congressionally-authorized foreign aid to help your re-election is an impeachable offense. Congress must use all of its powers to get to the bottom of this. https://nyti.ms/2ktVApl ,1176181137154236416,2019-09-23,17:06:50,reppeterdefazio,62,137,421
"Trumpland this wk: EPA water chief David Ross repeatedly dodged questions about the scientific basis for the deregulation, prompting Rep.

"50 years ago pollution was so bad, rivers caught on fire. Now, the Trump administration is proposing a #DirtyWaterRule that would radically reinterpret Clean Water Act protections- virtually assuring extensive damage to rivers, streams, lakes, and more throughout the country. pic.twitter.com/xZq3V92Ud1",1174323135992279040,2019-09-18,14:03:48,reppeterdefazio,7,36,77

"Intro’d today: my #ActfortheAmazon Act, HR 4263, would ban key imports and halt military and security assistance to Brazil until President Bolsonaro takes action to combat rainforest wildfires.
