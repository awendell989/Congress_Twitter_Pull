Today I toured the Coast Community Health Center's future facility at the former Umpqua Bank Bldg in Port Orford. It will provide vital services to the community while the full-service campus on Tichenor is being built. Thx to CCHC for their dedication and innovative care. pic.twitter.com/kiCf4Uej55,1166877785941561345,2019-08-29,00:58:38,reppeterdefazio,8,2,23
"40% of West Coast wild salmon spawn in the Tongass. It’s the single most important US forest for carbon sequestration. Repealing the roadless rule would escalate the climate crisis, harm OR fisheries and undermine Alaska’s recreation and tourism industry. https://wapo.st/2LbKKOb ",1166819250910179328,2019-08-28,21:06:02,reppeterdefazio,5,36,74
"This is reckless, shameless and wrong. The USCG is among the best defenses we have for stopping drugs and human trafficking, TSA is on the frontlines of airport security, & thousands of Americans are waiting for relief via FEMA’s Disaster Fund. https://nbcnews.to/30OeZ4x ",1166515476400418818,2019-08-28,00:58:57,reppeterdefazio,29,6,29
Bolsonaro cannot act with impunity and accelerate the destruction of the Amazon. There are real-life consequences for his recklessness.

I sent a letter to AG Barr questioning the legality of surveillance of Oregonians opposed to the Jordan Cove project. Spying on law-abiding Americans who oppose a potential federal action goes against the fundamental freedoms of every American. https://bit.ly/2H5cH91 ,1161366316349046791,2019-08-13,19:58:01,reppeterdefazio,8,24,65
Each species is integral to the health of our planet's ecosystem. Trump's erosion of the ESA is one piece of his larger plan to reward the fossil fuel industry and other special interests which threaten humanity's survival at a critical point in our fight against climate change.,1161359587716542467,2019-08-13,19:31:17,reppeterdefazio,3,16,69
