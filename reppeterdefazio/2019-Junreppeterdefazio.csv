"Four years ago, SCOTUS made history by ruling same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. We've come a long way in the fight for LGBTQ equality, but still have much to do.

President Trump is wrong. The Constitution states the President needs congressional approval before attacking any country. My War Powers bill would strengthen Congress’s war powers authority & require an exit strategy for any US military action: https://bit.ly/2X62WBs ,1143635046546452480,2019-06-25,21:40:17,reppeterdefazio,10,7,44

The Trump Administration has come to its senses and has REVERSED the decision to close the Job Corps CCC programs—highly successful programs that train low-income youth to become first responders for natural disasters.

The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world—more than $1000 per capita.
