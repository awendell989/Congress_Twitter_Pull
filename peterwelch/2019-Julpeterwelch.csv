"Great news! The House passed the bipartisan #StopBadRobocalls Act to stop the onslaught of robocalls once and for all. This comprehensive bill requires every call to be verified, allows the blocking of spam calls, & empowers @FCC to protect Americans from scammers. #vtpoli pic.twitter.com/8wth3xWO9m",1154469117673398272,2019-07-25,19:11:01,peterwelch,2,9,23
Here’s my exchange with Mueller this afternoon. He agreed: 1) Significant evidence of Trump campaign conspiring with Russians; 2) Foreign interference in U.S. elections may be the “new normal.” #vtpoli #MuellerHearings https://twitter.com/vicenews/status/1154118600967409664 …,1154136134038896640,2019-07-24,21:07:51,peterwelch,20,25,64

The Trump Administration has embraced a lawsuit being argued right now in the 5th Circuit that would repeal health care coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions.

Those who posted these vile comments should not be wearing the uniform of the @CBP. DHS leaders must come before Congress to explain how they will hold these employees accountable & ensure that CBP culture does not condone this despicable behavior. https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-border-patrol-facebook-group-agents-joke-about-migrant-deaths-post-sexist-memes …,1146477705749098496,2019-07-03,17:56:00,peterwelch,4,3,16
