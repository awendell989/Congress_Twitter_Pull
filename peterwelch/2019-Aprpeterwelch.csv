AG Barr MUST appear before ALL House committees seeking his testimony about the #MuellerReport.  It’s time for him to decide if he is the chief law enforcement officer for the nation or the President’s personal attorney.,1122935374546898949,2019-04-29,18:47:11,peterwelch,16,31,92
Great to join @ecfibernet representatives and other community leaders in Randolph yesterday to hear about innovative community broadband models.
