Tourism is a key driver of the Vermont economy. The president has signed into law my bipartisan legislation to boost Vermont and other states as a destination for international tourists. Renewing BrandUSA is win for Vermont! #vtpoli,1209119905758502912,2019-12-23,14:33:44,peterwelch,5,5,52

This great shirt came just in time for the holidays! I’m so proud of the @BurlingtonVTSchools soccer team for standing up for equality. It’s time to end pay disparity once and for all. Equal work deserves equal pay. #vtpoli pic.twitter.com/syAUaXtRan,1208108906133774336,2019-12-20,19:36:23,peterwelch,7,26,263

"Jake Carpenter, founder of @burtonsnowboard, was a pioneer and visionary in the world of snowboarding. More importantly, he was a loving husband, a great boss, and an extraordinary man. This morning, I paid tribute to him on the House floor. Rest in Peace, Jake. #RideonJake pic.twitter.com/2YbY3RYRuY",1204882761993129984,2019-12-11,21:56:50,peterwelch,5,24,108

I joined with @SenatorLeahy and @SenSanders to strongly oppose the Trump Administration’s proposed changes to SNAP. Vermonters should not be forced to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families. Here is our letter to @SecretarySonny. #vtpoli pic.twitter.com/Mzq7EO6J3i,1201972018532552704,2019-12-03,21:10:35,peterwelch,8,49,150
