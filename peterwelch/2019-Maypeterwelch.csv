Today I met with passionate leaders who are advancing #Vermont’s outdoor recreation economy. Any day spent outdoors in the Green Mountain State is a great day! pic.twitter.com/pb7qR8D6nk,1134540337886765061,2019-05-31,19:21:09,peterwelch,1,2,16

I was in Vergennes today to honor the Vermonters who served but did not make it home. Thanks to those who put themselves in harm’s way to protect our country. #MemorialDay pic.twitter.com/rBwMK7ZtpS,1133049296998281216,2019-05-27,16:36:18,peterwelch,5,7,69

Great to see so many gathered in Montpelier tonight to oppose nationwide efforts to turn back the clock on women’s reproductive health. #StopTheBans #vtpoli pic.twitter.com/NhfeK9op6W,1130966059253665792,2019-05-21,22:38:15,peterwelch,8,3,42
Today I held Big Pharma’s feet to the fire on why they are jacking up drug prices so high. They say it is because they spend big money on research and development yet they refuse to reveal how much they actually spend on that.  Why? What are they hiding?

Vermonters are fed up with intrusive robocalls that are annoying at best and predatory at worst. Today I’m at Burlington Airport talking about legislation that I’ve cosponsored to put an end to this explosion of unwanted robocalls. #vtpoli pic.twitter.com/1w8Mcs70Mt,1128324819261566977,2019-05-14,15:42:54,peterwelch,3,9,43
High-speed internet is mandatory in the modern economy. Yet 25 million Americans in rural communities still don’t have access.
