Trump may not have pulled the trigger but his hateful rhetoric is providing the powder. These massacres are hate crimes. The president is debasing his office with coded but transparent hate speech in our name. Hate speech has consequences: hate crimes. #vtpoli,1158086440296898560,2019-08-04,18:44:58,peterwelch,14,27,105
What’s more “sickening” @senatemajldr is that you and @realDonaldTrump hold the keys to common sense gun reforms. The nation is reeling. Lead on this or get out of the way! #vtpoli https://twitter.com/senatemajldr/status/1158036816089497601 …,1158085487485161472,2019-08-04,18:41:11,peterwelch,1,20,73
