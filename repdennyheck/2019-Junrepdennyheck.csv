The national security threats from climate change are too many to count. That's why I've introduced legislation creating the Climate Security Intelligence Center.

Last week I introduced the Climate Security Intelligence Act to help the intelligence community better analyze and mitigate the security threats posed by climate change. https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/for-americas-security-we-cant-afford-to-play-catch-up-with-climate-change/ …,1138221852264992768,2019-06-10,23:10:11,repdennyheck,1,20,44
This is precisely why we need the Climate Security Intelligence Act – so that career intelligence professionals and scientists can better collaborate on how to mitigate the effects of climate change with less political interference. #ClimateSecurity https://wapo.st/31xp6eK ,1138199018331414528,2019-06-10,21:39:27,repdennyheck,1,7,19
