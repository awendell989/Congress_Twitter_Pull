I had a very extraordinary engagement this week with Professor Jordan Peterson. A bipartisan group of Members met with him for dialogue. Many people seem captivated by his provocative work. @jordanbpeterson,1073646344772964352,2018-12-14,18:30:10,jefffortenberry,68,2,6

There was a sense in America during President George H.W. Bush's tenure that he came from an elite life of privilege.  That perception in no way captures the fullness of this man’s journey.  https://bit.ly/2rpgXrV  #Bush41,1071151271132966912,2018-12-07,21:15:38,jefffortenberry,36,2,8

We have outsourced everything to Washington. We have nationalized every conceivable problem. Congress is not a 24/7 alarm to be set off by the media whenever it wants to generate crises and entertainment. This is not Netflix. https://bit.ly/2PcgcvE ,1068693426584076289,2018-12-01,02:29:02,jefffortenberry,17,3,13
