Trump has no idea of the economic catastrophe he will cause on border communities and throughout the country with his misguided decision to close the border. Brash actions that do nothing to address the humanitarian situation at the border solve nothing. http://ow.ly/5Ine30okeHx ,1113834927668322305,2019-04-04,16:05:15,repraulgrijalva,6,12,28
I’m truly thankful for all the young people at today’s @ClimateCrisis hearing. They’ve grown up with years of silence and inaction on the most pressing issue of our lives. This isn’t “activism.” This is being a good citizen. #ClimateActionNow https://twitter.com/NRDems/status/1113807198524792838 …,1113808871724912642,2019-04-04,14:21:43,repraulgrijalva,3,50,118

Thank you @RepVisclosky for rejecting DOD's initial request to illegally circumvent Congress and move around funds to construct a useless border wall. #NoBorderWall https://twitter.com/RepRaulGrijalva/status/1113189803284140034 …,1113191390412984322,2019-04-02,21:28:04,repraulgrijalva,5,7,24
The Dept of Defense is trying to illegally move around funds to build Trump's monument to his racist policies. I wrote to @AppropsDems urging them to include language in the appropriations bill to prohibit the transfer of funds for border wall construction in FY20. #NoBorderWall pic.twitter.com/J1acTfaHxO,1113189803284140034,2019-04-02,21:21:45,repraulgrijalva,6,13,21
