Dysfunctional Dems do nothing!",1201867805831946245,2019-12-03,14:16:29,congressmanhice,99,299,581
"🚨 MUST READ🚨
 
After nearly two months of depositions & handpicked witness testimonies, the Democrats' impeachment plot has been busted by the evidence & facts.
 
Key points: no quid pro quo, no bribery, no impeachable offense.
 
Yet another nail in their political impeachment. https://twitter.com/GOPoversight/status/1201622821098659845 …",1201632814371950592,2019-12-02,22:42:42,congressmanhice,36,117,201
"Two days away from the latest round of impeachment hearings and @JudiciaryGOP committee members — and the American people — are once again left in the dark.

This sham is absurd, unjust, and beg's the question, what else are they concealing? https://twitter.com/RepDougCollins/status/1201591134725775361 …",1201629809970950144,2019-12-02,22:30:46,congressmanhice,81,222,447
"Since day one, this impeachment sham has been a partisan witch hunt.

It looks and smells like a third-world kangaroo court with basic due process rights and fairness being thrown out the window.

It’s truly frightening to see this happening in America!",1201488325418377222,2019-12-02,13:08:34,congressmanhice,81,503,1475
"Great op-ed by my friend & former colleague @jasoninthehouse.

Just one point to add:

In the CR to fund the government through Christmas, @HouseDemocrats attached a provision extending #FISA for 4 months – putting it well past the IG report on FISA abuse.

Coincidence? Doubtful. https://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse/status/1201157644469358592 …",1201245144630075392,2019-12-01,21:02:15,congressmanhice,8,32,64
"Spot on, @RepLeeZeldin.

As public opposition skyrockets, more Democrats will jump ship this week.

Judiciary Chairman Nadler is desperate to make up for his total bust of a hearing with Bob Mueller.

Thought the #SchiffShow was bad?

Tune in Dec. 4th to see the #NadlerNetwork. https://twitter.com/RepLeeZeldin/status/1200897229835382785 …",1201161615753859072,2019-12-01,15:30:20,congressmanhice,67,294,733
