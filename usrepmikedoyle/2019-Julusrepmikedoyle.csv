"Today, President Trump spoke extensively about managing wildfires and cleaning up ocean garbage - but he failed to mention the underlying, larger issue of climate change AT ALL.

"Reduced carbon emissions are NOT a call for fewer regulations, @POTUS! They are a sign that our efforts are working to #ActOnClimate and protect human health - and we need to do more to combat air pollution, not less.

Great to see that @UNESCO designated Frank Lloyd Wright’s @Fallingwater as a #WorldHeritage site! This is the highest honor for a cultural site and the second designation in PA.
