(3/3) What we witnessed today in the House Judiciary Committee was nothing more than a political circus. I hope that this exercise satisfies House Democrats and maybe now we can move on to working on real issues that are facing this country.,1154105803156201474,2019-07-24,19:07:20,repgregsteube,77,106,279
"(2/3) I asked Mr. Mueller how in 2 years of investigating, not once did he consider looking into how an unverified document—that was paid for by a political party—was used to obtain a warrant to spy on an opposing political campaign. He didn’t seem to have an answer.",1154105801973424133,2019-07-24,19:07:20,repgregsteube,25,100,225

Hey @realDonaldTrump who do you think deserves better healthcare—illegal immigrants or our veterans? https://twitter.com/RepGregSteube/status/1151863443798056961 …,1151900459323535360,2019-07-18,17:04:05,repgregsteube,84,92,178
I’m leading the fight to stop House Democrats from giving better healthcare to illegal immigrants than our nation’s veterans. LIKE and RETWEET if you agree. pic.twitter.com/p9pSCM2AXc,1151863443798056961,2019-07-18,14:37:00,repgregsteube,70,172,306
"Great to join @trish_regan to discuss next week's hearing with Former Special Counsel Mueller. If I'm given the chance to question Mr. Mueller, I look forward to asking him how his investigation began and how we got to this point. https://youtu.be/GvKaDJ5kgus ",1151153617077977088,2019-07-16,15:36:24,repgregsteube,46,11,32
We must keep Guantanamo Bay open and keep violent terrorists out of the United States.,1149681903114629121,2019-07-12,14:08:20,repgregsteube,17,15,45
House Democrats stripped this provision from the #NDAA because they are soft on terror and they want to close Guantanamo Bay. Our national security will suffer because of their actions.,1149681902334423040,2019-07-12,14:08:20,repgregsteube,3,15,19

This means that terrorists who are currently being held at Guantanamo Bay can be transferred to a neighborhood near you.,1149681900929392641,2019-07-12,14:08:19,repgregsteube,2,8,10
"This year, House Democrats chose to remove the provision from the #NDAA and also blocked an attempt by @RepRalphNorman to add the language to the bill through the amendment process.",1149681900094726145,2019-07-12,14:08:19,repgregsteube,2,3,8
Every #NDAA since FY 2010 included a provision to prohibit the use of funds to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States.,1149681899453014016,2019-07-12,14:08:19,repgregsteube,4,7,12
"For decades the #NDAA has been a bipartisan bill—even this year in the Senate their version passed 86-8. But instead, House Democrats chose to play political games with our national security.",1149679806776250369,2019-07-12,14:00:00,repgregsteube,3,4,9
"This year, House Democrats chose to put partisanship in front of our national interests, our national security, and our servicemembers in their #NDAA.",1149676417644294144,2019-07-12,13:46:32,repgregsteube,5,28,37

He wants to limit debate to only a #Famous11 while denying me and my colleagues the opportunity to ask questions of Mr. Mueller. The American people deserve better.,1149431638667014146,2019-07-11,21:33:52,repgregsteube,15,83,153
