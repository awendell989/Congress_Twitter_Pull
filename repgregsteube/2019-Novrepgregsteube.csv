This impeachment is completely partisan—all you have to do is read the transcript to see there’s nothing impeachable. Floridians are frustrated  because Congress is not doing the job they sent us to do. It’s time we put this nonsense behind us & focus on the needs of the country! pic.twitter.com/xJ2AqpCzVZ,1194663567796187138,2019-11-13,17:09:24,repgregsteube,59,129,248
