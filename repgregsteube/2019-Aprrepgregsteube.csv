"As a veteran who deals with the VA frequently, I know that the VA is in need of serious reform. Unlike @RepAOC, I've seen first hand the sub-par treatment our veterans receive and I know they deserve better.

"Obviously @RepAOC has never dealt with the VA if she thinks their standard of care is what our veterans deserve. But then again, she wants government run heath care for all, so she can't admit the faults with the VA without admitting issues with her plan https://washex.am/2XEedoK ",1120691685187575810,2019-04-23,14:11:33,repgregsteube,7,12,21

Rep. Omar has taken her comments from anti-Semitic to anti-American. I will not stand by as she dismisses the most brutal terrorist attack on our soil in American history. @SpeakerPelosi must condemn her actions and remove her from her committees. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1116817144006750209 …,1117819327149948928,2019-04-15,15:57:50,repgregsteube,13,37,75
