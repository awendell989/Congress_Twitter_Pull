I hope that this exercise satisfies House Democrats and maybe now we can move on to working on real issues that are facing this country.,1154105803156201474,2019-07-24,19:07:20,repgregsteube,77,106,279,2019-07-24 19:07:20
"(2/3) I asked Mr. Mueller how in 2 years of investigating, not once did he consider looking into how an unverified document—that was paid for by a political party—was used to obtain a warrant to spy on an opposing political campaign.

House Democrats stripped this provision from the #NDAA because they are soft on terror and they want to close Guantanamo Bay. Our national security will suffer because of their actions.,1149681902334423040,2019-07-12,14:08:20,repgregsteube,3,15,19,2019-07-12 14:08:20
