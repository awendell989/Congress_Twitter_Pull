I am disappointed in @SenSchumer vote against USMCA. This GREAT trade deal will help our dairy farmers and manufacturers in New York. There is no explanation for him to go thumbs down on this other than him being railroaded by those in the extreme left of the Democratic Party.,1217871434837635073,2020-01-16,18:09:11,reptomreed,19,7,33

I have and will continue to chastise Congress for being political cowards on these matters. I demand Congress do its job and vote on the appropriate resolution which would either deny or authorize the use of such military force. (4/4),1213172200410353664,2020-01-03,18:56:06,reptomreed,25,3,9
"However, if the situation with Iran escalates further and requires a large increase or long-term commitment of our military men and women, Congress must not hide behind the outdated Authorizations of Military Force resolutions. (3/4)",1213172199466647552,2020-01-03,18:56:06,reptomreed,12,3,4
I also appreciate the President's decision not to commit the mistake of prior administrations when they failed to seize the moment and take out dangerous threats like Osama Bin Laden ‚Äì who was able to lead the heinous acts of 9/11. (2/4),1213172198648811520,2020-01-03,18:56:06,reptomreed,4,1,3
Soleimani had American blood on his hands. I appreciate President Trump's swift action to hold the Iranian regime accountable for their acts of terror against Americans. (1/4),1213172197482733568,2020-01-03,18:56:06,reptomreed,22,3,13
