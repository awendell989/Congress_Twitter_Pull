Hourly pay went up 3.4% last month. The biggest increase in 10 years! Much more beneficial to hardworking Americans than the #MuellerReport. https://cnb.cx/2CgEEIQ¬†,1111307067699142656,2019-03-28,16:40:26,reptomreed,10,1,6
Will @SpeakerPelosi put the American worker first and put USMCA on the floor for a vote or hold out in order to deny the President a win? We need action now! pic.twitter.com/X3mhQ3v8yD,1110970911660957697,2019-03-27,18:24:40,reptomreed,18,1,8
#SinceGOPTaxCuts unemployment for women reached its LOWEST rate in 65 years. Americans want leadership that steps up and delivers results like this.

Why is @nygovcuomo so concerned with protecting the 1 percent?? Tax reform helped middle class families. Maybe the Gov should lower taxes across the board if he is scared of people like @stevenmnuchin1 leaving the state because of HIS high taxes.
