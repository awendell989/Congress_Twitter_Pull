President Trump continues to disparage immigrants seeking asylum with no evidence for his claims. These immigrants are mostly women and children. They'd be following the law—not breaking it—if they present themselves at a port of entry requesting asylum. https://medium.com/@SenFeinstein/fear-mongering-about-immigrants-must-stop-d2f090f2090c …,1058437789392531461,2018-11-02,19:16:48,senfeinstein,990,1161,2375,2018-11-02 19:16:48
