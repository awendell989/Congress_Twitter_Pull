The Senate is standing in the way of transparency and accountability by playing games with the rules of the impeachment trial. Mr. Bolton should be called to testify and the Senate should hold a fair and open trial for the American public to see. #DefendOurDemocracy https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1214250869983793163 …,1214314795903549440,2020-01-06,22:36:22,repdesaulnier,10,9,48
