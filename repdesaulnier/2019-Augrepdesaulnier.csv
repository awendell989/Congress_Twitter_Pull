I call on @senatemajldr to immediately bring the Senate back from recess to pass the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. Democrats passed this bill as one of our first acts when we took the House majority. It's proven to save lives & over 90% of the American people support it.,1158425093254418432,2019-08-05,17:10:39,repdesaulnier,3,10,27
I told @KTVU that this can't go on. It just can't. President #Trump has blood on his hands. He knows what he's saying is hateful. He knows it's divisive. He's the first president that I can remember that has been deliberately divisive in trying to drive people apart. #Enough pic.twitter.com/moL340DtsU,1158424829487222786,2019-08-05,17:09:36,repdesaulnier,14,10,46
