We have an untenable humanitarian crisis at our Southern border.  I call on my colleagues to negotiate a bipartisan solution with real #BorderSecurity to solve the immigration crisis and end the #GovernmentShutdown. #VA05 pic.twitter.com/3DweJ38S0t,1083011123723546624,2019-01-09,14:42:27,repriggleman,6,14,44
It’s time to exhibit moral courage. We have a real crisis at the border because partisan politics is put before real solutions. Years of gridlock on border security has created an untenable humanitarian situation. Let's come to table and work on real immigration reform NOW!,1082821256188231680,2019-01-09,02:07:59,repriggleman,17,41,109
