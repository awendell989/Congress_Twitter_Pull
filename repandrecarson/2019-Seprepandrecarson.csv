"I just voted to terminate President Trump's Border Emergency. 

This #FakeEmergency is nothing but a scheme to build his ineffective wall by diverting money from important military projects. It's not only xenophobic, it's fiscally irresponsible and an insult to our troops.",1177611768471969792,2019-09-27,15:51:39,repandrecarson,18,15,126
"We must not forget that while #Trump distracts with spin and gaslighting about the #whistleblower investigation, he also is continuing his assault on other American values.
