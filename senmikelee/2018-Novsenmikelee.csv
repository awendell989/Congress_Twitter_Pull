"Lengthy and punitive mandatory minimums have a high human cost that is often ignored by the criminal justice system. The #FirstStepAct makes our communities safer by encouraging rehabilitation that reunites parents, siblings, spouses, and children. http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-the-sentence-looks-at-mandatory-minimum-sentences-1381532739939?v=railb& …",1067538968273711104,2018-11-27,22:01:38,senmikelee,214,150,425
"As a former federal prosecutor, I know from experience that dangerous criminals exist.

Solid explanation as to why I’ve introduced the PURE Act and other public lands bills. We in the west love our lands; we just want those of us who live there to have a more direct say in what happens to them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LruaD7XhQ50&feature=share …,1067104979150884864,2018-11-26,17:17:07,senmikelee,58,26,115

"This is a complete subject change  from the claims in your original tweets, @SenTomCotton.

Read the bill. Earning time credits does not grant an inmate release. Inmates must still undergo risk assessment and be deemed low-risk offenders. https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/1064629018492841984 …,1064634614214479872,2018-11-19,21:40:46,senmikelee,57,138,600
If @SenTomCotton has good faith problems with this bill then he should welcome a full and open debate on the Senate floor where he can offer amendments to provisions he finds objectionable. But first this bill needs to be brought to the Senate floor so debate can begin. /END,1064615669294137344,2018-11-19,20:25:29,senmikelee,111,480,3083
Nothing in the First Step Act gives inmates early release. It only incentivizes participation in recidivism reduction programs. At all times the Bureau of Prisons retains all authority over who does and does not qualify for early release. 5/,1064615627858604032,2018-11-19,20:25:19,senmikelee,27,243,1411
What the First Step Act does do is encourage rehabilitation by incentivizing inmates to participate in recidivism reduction programs by giving them time credits that can help them qualify for prerelease custody. 4/,1064615547860631552,2018-11-19,20:25:00,senmikelee,31,229,1411
"Second, and more importantly, the First Step Act does not “give early release” to anyone. Anyone claiming it does, does not understand how the bill works. 3/",1064615494571970563,2018-11-19,20:24:48,senmikelee,8,237,1478
"First, the House Judiciary committee passed the First Step Act out of committee on May 9 of this year, and the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the highly similar Sentencing and Corrections Act out of committee on Feb 15 of this year.
