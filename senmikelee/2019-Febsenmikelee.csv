It saddens me that so many of my colleagues do not believe that all born citizens should be protected by federal law. But we will not let this vote get us down.

My initial assessment is that what Pres. Trump announced is legal. Whether or not it should be legal is a different matter. Congress has been ceding far too much power to the exec. branch for decades. We should use this moment as an opportunity to start taking that power back.,1096498961689518080,2019-02-15,19:58:19,senmikelee,2781,2169,9473
