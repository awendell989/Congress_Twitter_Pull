So thank you President Trump for doing all you can to protect Religious Freedom on Religious Freedom Day. https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/01/16/hhs-announces-proposed-rule-regarding-equal-treatment-faith-based-organizations-hhs-supported-social-service-programs.html …,1217916619357327360,2020-01-16,21:08:44,senmikelee,72,61,288
