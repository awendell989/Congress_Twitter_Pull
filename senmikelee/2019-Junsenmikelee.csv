The Constitution intentionally gave lawmaking power exclusively to the most accountable branch of government -- Congress. It is far past time Congress took these legislative powers back. We can start with the Global Trade Accountability Act. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/13/congress-must-take-back-trade-authority-mexico-column/1424800001/ …,1139167535788675073,2019-06-13,13:47:59,senmikelee,189,83,322

Wild horses are a beautiful feature of the American West and can be a healthy part of a properly managed ecosystem.
