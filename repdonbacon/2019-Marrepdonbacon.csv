We‚Äôve had occurrences where our subs were found and vulnerable... and learned after the fact. We can‚Äôt afford that when it comes to deterrence. We need all three to safeguard our country from nuclear war.,1103359636088999936,2019-03-06,18:20:11,repdonbacon,0,0,0
I believe your proposals add risk and increase odds for miscalculation. The TRIAD has served us well. I‚Äôll continue to advocate for a strong and modernized TRIAD.,1103359057220505602,2019-03-06,18:17:53,repdonbacon,2,0,0

My intent is to ensure we have a survivable second strike capability. The proposal to go down to five submarines and 49 bombers doesn‚Äôt do that. I don‚Äôt want to barely have enough deterrence... we want an overwhelming deterrence capability to prevent Russian miscalculation.,1103358326031695873,2019-03-06,18:14:58,repdonbacon,2,0,2
