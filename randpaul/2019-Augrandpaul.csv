It’s interesting several of the U.S. Senators now wanting to travel to Russia voted against allowing Russian legislators to travel to the United States. @realDonaldTrump is right to want diplomacy. https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/27/russia-senate-trump-putin-1476100 …,1166475012330655744,2019-08-27,22:18:09,randpaul,250,501,2187

Had a great discussion with @charliekirk11 recently on why it’s important for the U.S. to focus more domestically and stop wasting so much of our precious resources abroad in places like Afghanistan! @realdonaldtrump understands this!  https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rand-paul-renegade/id1460600818?i=1000447417890 …,1164651854900400128,2019-08-22,21:33:35,randpaul,395,1059,4130

Why is the United States always stuck paying for everyone when prosperous nations don’t pay their fair share? @RichardGrenell is absolutely right.
