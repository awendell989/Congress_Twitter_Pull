President Trump shows no interest in doing the work to protect the Southern Border and instead spends his time disparaging the vulnerable. Cutting aid to Central America is a cruel political stunt that will only escalate problems.

Thank you for joining this #FridayFocus on the President’s budget and how Congress starts its appropriations process.  Stay tuned for future updates as we continue crafting legislation that will fund the government in fiscal year 2020.,1111734821418688514,2019-03-29,21:00:11,repsires,0,0,4
Congress holds the power of the purse and it is important that we craft a thoughtful budget that takes into account the needs of Americans – not just the desires of the President.,1111732764259377152,2019-03-29,20:52:00,repsires,1,1,4
As we continue on the appropriations process I’ll be sharing more info about the programs I support and why.,1111732763416244224,2019-03-29,20:52:00,repsires,3,0,4
"To name just a few – I’m supporting funding for medical research, affordable housing programs, Community 
Development Block Grants, community health centers, law enforcement grants, and gun violence prevention measures.",1111731267974905857,2019-03-29,20:46:03,repsires,1,2,6

"Deadlines are set for when these letters of support are then sent to one of the 12 subcommittees with specific jurisdiction over these programs, where they are reviewed by appropriators and used to create a final budget resolution.",1111731266527866882,2019-03-29,20:46:03,repsires,1,0,3
These letters outline recommended funding levels for programs important to our constituents.,1111730597871923201,2019-03-29,20:43:24,repsires,1,0,3
"This is where the appropriations process comes in.  Congress appropriates funding to different departments and each member can circulate and sign letters of support for programs, agencies, or priorities.",1111730597322506241,2019-03-29,20:43:24,repsires,1,0,3
"As I mentioned, along with oversight we also play a role in the crafting of a budget resolution and the eventual bills that set funding levels for the next fiscal year.",1111729508456038400,2019-03-29,20:39:04,repsires,1,0,3
"It is important that we have the opportunity to hear from these officials because, although the Executive Branch does not have the power of the purse, they are in charge of overseeing the execution of the programs that Congress funds and it is important to get their insight.",1111729507772366850,2019-03-29,20:39:04,repsires,1,0,3
As a newly appointed member of the @budgetdems it is now my responsibility to question officials on funding levels and the Committee has had three administration members come in to discuss the sharp cuts to numerous non-defense programs.,1111725727987236865,2019-03-29,20:24:03,repsires,1,1,4

One of the Committee’s main responsibilities is to carry out oversight on budget proposals that are presented to Congress.,1111724614789550080,2019-03-29,20:19:37,repsires,1,0,1
The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 created the Budget Committee to allow Congress to develop a self-governing group of members to analyze the President’s budget proposal and unite it with congressional plans.,1111723344821395456,2019-03-29,20:14:34,repsires,1,0,2
"It’s important to note, though, that these are just suggestions. The budget is what the president *wants* programs/agencies/departments to be funded at – Congress reviews the wish list and changes it to reflect *its* own priorities.",1111723344234270720,2019-03-29,20:14:34,repsires,1,0,2
"So, for example, if a president thinks affordable housing or the Special Olympics are good, positive things that the government should get behind, his budget proposal will include funding for the departments that oversee those programs.",1111721920939085825,2019-03-29,20:08:55,repsires,1,3,3
"So, each year the President sends his proposed budget – what he would ideally like Congress to do – for members of Congress to review.   A budget is like a statement of principles – a president’s budget will mirror a president's values.",1111721920217735168,2019-03-29,20:08:55,repsires,1,3,3
"Everything from the Department of Defense to the National Institutes of Health fall under the Executive Branch and each year funding levels must be set. However, the President does not have the power of the purse – the Constitution explicitly gives that authority to Congress.",1111720662501113856,2019-03-29,20:03:55,repsires,1,1,3
The President’s budget is a (very large) document outlining the Administration’s policy priorities and how they ought to be funded. The document itself is very large because the Executive Branch oversees massive government agencies.,1111720661909671936,2019-03-29,20:03:55,repsires,1,1,3
"Overall, the federal budget process is straightforward: in the spring, the president proposes a budget, Congress reviews that budget, and then Congress tries to agree on a final budget resolution.",1111719365110583296,2019-03-29,19:58:46,repsires,1,1,3
"On March 11, 2019, the President released his budget proposal for the next fiscal year.  This budget goes to Congress and is available to the public as a statement of the administration’s priorities.  For today’s #FridayFocus let’s look at how the budget process actually works.",1111718393911099392,2019-03-29,19:54:54,repsires,1,6,10
