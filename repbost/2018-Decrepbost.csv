US has highest maternal mortality rate in developed world. That's why I cosponsored HR1318 the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act to establish & support Maternal Mortality Review Committees.

Too many #veterans faced intolerable delays during VA‚Äôs benefits claims appeal process. That‚Äôs why I introduced #bipartisan legislation that was signed into law to modernize the system and ensure our veterans get the help they need in a more efficient and effective manner. #twill https://twitter.com/HouseVetAffairs/status/1071054345481977861¬†‚Ä¶,1072216784487489538,2018-12-10,19:49:36,repbost,4,4,15

Tracy and I are saddened to hear of the passing of President George H. W. Bush. His service to our nation began in WWII and extended to the highest office in the land. He was a true public servant and a man of unquestioned character. The Bush family is in our prayers. #twill,1068876394447421440,2018-12-01,14:36:05,repbost,0,5,21
