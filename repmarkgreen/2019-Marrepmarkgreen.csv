H.R. 1 is a misguided bill with many problems. One problem in particular has united everyone from @heritage to the @ACLU. It‚Äôs the bill‚Äôs assault on free speech. The ACLU itself says H.R. 1 will ‚Äúchill speech essential to our public discourse‚Äù.  https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4785035/rep-mark-green-offers-free-speech-amendment-hr-1¬†‚Ä¶,1103788905332121600,2019-03-07,22:45:57,repmarkgreen,6,35,58
I offered an amendment on the House Floor today to H.R. 1 expressing the sense of Congress that free speech should be protected.
