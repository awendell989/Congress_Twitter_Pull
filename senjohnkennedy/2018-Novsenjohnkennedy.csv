"This week I’ve been working to convince my Senate colleagues that a lapse in NFIP would be a disservice to families across the country, & especially for us in Louisiana.

I strongly believe that you can learn much more from substitute teaching than you can from sitting in 100 hours of committee testimony. That’s why I've taken the time to substitute teach in a Louisiana classroom every year for the past decade. pic.twitter.com/yPXDJiyoQq,1064916084002820097,2018-11-20,16:19:14,senjohnkennedy,63,147,574
