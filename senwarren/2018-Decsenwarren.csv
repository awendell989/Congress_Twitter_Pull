American workers have helped create record corporate profits – but their wages have stayed flat for decades as companies reward CEOs and wealthy shareholders instead. My Accountable Capitalism Act would empower workers and help them get what they deserve. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/opinion/elizabeth-warren-2020-accountable-capitalism.html …,1069637988471193600,2018-12-03,17:02:24,senwarren,430,1319,3912
