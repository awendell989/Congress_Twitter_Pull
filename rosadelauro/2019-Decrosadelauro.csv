Thank you to @RepMaloney for ensuring federal workers get 12 weeks of paid parental leave. A big win for workers as we continue the fight to ensure all workers have access to paid family and medical leave through the #FAMILYAct. #paidleave,1204911975601442821,2019-12-11,23:52:55,rosadelauro,9,15,69

The Trump administration and the @USDA are rigging SNAP against the very people who the program was created to help. This rule will weaken our country's safety net and take food away from hundreds of thousands of people. #HandsOffSNAP https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/12/04/trump-administration-tightens-work-requirements-snap-which-could-cut-hundreds-thousands-food-stamps/ …,1202321841815195648,2019-12-04,20:20:39,rosadelauro,4,12,12
