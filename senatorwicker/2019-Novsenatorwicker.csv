"#MedicareForAll would eventually empty the U.S. Treasury. With no money left to spend, Medicare for All would become #MedicareForNone. #WickerReport  https://www.wicker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/11/wicker-urges-productive-health-care-reforms …",1192109888018644993,2019-11-06,16:02:00,senatorwicker,20,7,16
"With #MedicareForAll, only massive middle-class tax increases could pay for the costs. And, the policy would take away Americans’ health-care choices, increase wait times, and limit the potential for future medical innovations. #WickerReport  https://www.wicker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/11/wicker-urges-productive-health-care-reforms …",1191824759128051713,2019-11-05,21:09:00,senatorwicker,7,3,11
Republicans on Capitol Hill are ready to work with our Democratic colleagues on health care. But #MedicareForAll is a dangerous distraction. It would prevent positive reforms and could cause devastating results. #WickerReport  https://www.wicker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/11/wicker-urges-productive-health-care-reforms …,1191760586117283840,2019-11-05,16:54:00,senatorwicker,25,5,8

Today the @nationals celebrated their #WorldSeries win with @realDonaldTrump at the @WhiteHouse. Two players with Mississippi ties were on this year’s winning team. https://www.wapt.com/article/players-with-mississippi-ties-help-nationals-reach-world-series-10-16/29493677 …,1191486427718209541,2019-11-04,22:44:35,senatorwicker,4,4,22
I stand with @realDonaldTrump. He is keeping his promise and doing what is right for our country. It is time to make a clean break from the Paris agreement.,1191474905184948227,2019-11-04,21:58:48,senatorwicker,26,6,37
There is little evidence that the Paris agreement would significantly reduce global temperatures. Why would we put American livelihoods at risk and subject U.S. sovereignty to international litigation when the agreement offers little return on its investment?,1191474805280776192,2019-11-04,21:58:24,senatorwicker,121,80,286
Today @realDonaldTrump formally began the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement. This move reinforces his pro-growth agenda and will remove the United States from an ineffective international regulatory regime that would threaten our prosperity.,1191474763136425990,2019-11-04,21:58:14,senatorwicker,20,10,51
"Americans deserve a say in their health-care choices. Given the proper tools and regulatory framework, our citizens are more than capable of picking the best plans to fit their needs. #WickerReport  https://www.wicker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/11/wicker-urges-productive-health-care-reforms …",1191443245101768705,2019-11-04,19:53:00,senatorwicker,5,3,5
A recent study pegs the tab for #MedicareForAll at $34 trillion. The astronomical figure is another reminder of how unsustainable this proposal would be. #WickerReport  https://www.wicker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/11/wicker-urges-productive-health-care-reforms …,1191392542761406465,2019-11-04,16:31:31,senatorwicker,17,3,7
