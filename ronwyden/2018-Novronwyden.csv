"This problem isn’t going away. #ClimateChange is making extreme weather events more severe & common, so nursing homes need to be better prepared for natural disasters to avoid tragedies like the those that we witnessed in 2017.",1058488286803447808,2018-11-02,22:37:27,ronwyden,10,16,78
Families expect their loved ones to be safe and cared for in nursing homes. My report shows that these facilities aren’t prepared for natural disasters. @CMSGov & state regulators MUST do more to guarantee the safety of seniors during hurricanes. https://nyti.ms/2yOx7ip ,1058488284102352901,2018-11-02,22:37:27,ronwyden,2,9,16
