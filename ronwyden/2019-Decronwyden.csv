The Department of Energy’s failure to cooperate with the Senate when it comes to getting answers to key questions regarding Rick Perry's involvement in the ongoing Ukraine scandal is a full court stonewall. I won’t stop demanding those answers. https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1201647269025636352 …,1201883461738487808,2019-12-03,15:18:41,ronwyden,31,175,485
"Rick Perry was one of the ""Three Amigos"" in the Ukraine scheme. He blew off a subpoena, quit his job and skipped town.

I’m on the floor talking about Dan Brouillette’s nomination to replace Rick Perry as Energy Secretary. Perry is fleeing the department while questions remain regarding his role in the Ukraine scandal. The vote is minutes away. The Senate is in the dark. https://www.pscp.tv/w/cLV_ITFyYVFaREFBTEpManp8MXZPeHdhVnJiUG1HQqz7Wc5JC9D_S8Bk-x_EtpfZxkoRI0ny04rnL0qM2Yea …,1201620191924248577,2019-12-02,21:52:33,ronwyden,38,325,700

Shady voting machine manufacturers like ES&S are making millions in taxpayer-funded government contracts while leaving our elections vulnerable. @senatemajldr should stop listening to scandal-plagued companies like ES&S and pass my election security bill. https://www.propublica.org/article/the-market-for-voting-machines-is-broken-this-company-has-thrived-in-it …,1201575617281564672,2019-12-02,18:55:26,ronwyden,5,89,167
