"“Dazzling philosopher” is an excellent description of Roger Scruton. I regret I was never able to meet him in person. Roger gave instant and detailed clarity during our era, when brilliant rational thought is in short supply.

We should have added “eagle egg” to the list with “unborn child”. We might have peeled off a few more Democrats. https://twitter.com/nrlc/status/1215698641626763265 …,1215718585231925248,2020-01-10,19:34:32,stevekingia,61,31,72
"Pelosi’s strategy in refusing to message the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is, in part, an effort to delay @realDonaldTrump trial until after his State of the Union Address.

"Since the controversial “coup attempt” in 2016, human rights violations have been increasing in #Turkey, including this awful reality—nearly 2,000 babies and children under age 8 have had to live in prison and 864 remain behind bars with their mothers.

It’s a new year @JDScholten & you are still ducking & dodging. Every Democrat but one voted FOR impeachment. You are FOR #impeachment by default. You WILL have to answer the question: “Do you support impeachment?”@SimonRadio1776,1214712290542604288,2020-01-08,00:55:52,stevekingia,265,20,104
