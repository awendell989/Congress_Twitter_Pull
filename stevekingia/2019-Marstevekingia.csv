Judicial arrogance! An executive order by a previous president (Obama) cannot bind a subsequent president @realDonaldTrump Judge Gleason’s rationale: Obama “...intended them to extend indefinitely and therefore be revocable only by an act of Congress.”  https://pgj.cc/Swwf3p ,1112384934516326406,2019-03-31,16:03:30,stevekingia,113,231,437
"Shut it down and bring this saga of lawlessness to a close, @RealDonaldTrump. We can’t wait for the next election. Every day a huge caravan spreads itself across America.

Year-round E-15 seems to have come with an offset for the petroleum industry—more RIN waivers. The @EPA has again granted oil refiners biofuel waivers that undermine the #RFS. Billions of gallons of RFS blending will be extinguished. This action hurts our family farms.,1108041313109176320,2019-03-19,16:23:30,stevekingia,146,22,60
