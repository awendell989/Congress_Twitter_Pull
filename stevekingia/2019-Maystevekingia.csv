"America!
Freedom saved from death by war,
Nations rise as warriors fall.
We honor those who gave their lives
To save the flagship for it all.

Shall fill an honored grave, 
For glory lights the soldier's tomb, 
And beauty weeps the brave.""Drake pic.twitter.com/JF4tLPXQHD",1133079098765524992,2019-05-27,18:34:43,stevekingia,27,35,137
