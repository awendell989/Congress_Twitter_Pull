Appreciated the opportunity to visit the Columbus VA. We share many common goals including suicide prevention and stopping the misuse of opiate prescriptions among our veterans. We have a moral obligation as a nation to care for those who defend our country. pic.twitter.com/xmv8SzjT1L,1101253366104186880,2019-02-28,22:50:37,repstevestivers,5,1,14

Deeply saddened to learn of the cowardly terrorist attack on an Indian Central Reserve Police Force in Kashmir yesterday. The United States stands firm with our Indian partners in condemning the #KashmirTerrorAttack. We must fight against terrorism in all of its forms.,1096464220420521984,2019-02-15,17:40:16,repstevestivers,9,50,116

"Honored to be joined by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Ashenhurst for tonight’s #SOTU. She is a tireless advocate for #OH15’s veterans. There are plenty of issues Congress disagrees on, but caring for our nation’s veterans isn’t one of them. pic.twitter.com/Sz4rrMe6P4",1092985593615794181,2019-02-06,03:17:26,repstevestivers,2,2,21
