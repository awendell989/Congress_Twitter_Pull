I had a great meeting with new Cochise County Supervisor @teborer.

I had the privilege of meeting Maj. Gen. Laura Potter. She has been on the job for a week and has hit the ground running. It’s an honor to represent Fort Huachuca in Congress and I look forward to working with her as I fight to support her mission. #AZ02 pic.twitter.com/gtdDxzwQUG,1156990996497879041,2019-08-01,18:12:04,repkirkpatrick,0,4,10
