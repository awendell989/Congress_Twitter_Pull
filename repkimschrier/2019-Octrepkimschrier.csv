I found today's amendment on women's reproductive care on college campuses insulting. The fact that an abortion amendment was brought up during a discussion on higher education affordability is absurd. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ucfUYWqhq8&feature=youtu.be …,1189630037068267523,2019-10-30,19:47:57,repkimschrier,6,30,127
