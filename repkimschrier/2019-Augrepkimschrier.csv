"As a doctor and mom, I find the new policy of deporting children who had been protected under medical deferred action so cruel and horrifying.

What is often lost in the #EqualPay debate is that women of color earn even less than white women. Today is #BlackWomenEqualPay Day. Black women only earn $0.61 for every dollar a white man makes. We need equal pay for equal work for ALL women now.,1164631434587529217,2019-08-22,20:12:26,repkimschrier,4,4,24

The decision by our President and by Prime Minister Netanyahu to bar admission to Israel for two of my fellow congresswomen is wrong.

It’s been over 160 days since the House took action to prevent gun violence and the types of tragedies that happen far too often in this country.
