The restrictive abortion law in Missouri is an appalling setback for women in Missouri and across the country. The removal of in-state abortion providers harms women's rights and health care. Abortion must remain accessible. #StopTheBans https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/planned-parenthood-in-st-louis-could-stop-performing-abortions-as/article_35b27e68-2139-5aba-8306-3c0aa982291e.html#anchor_item_9 …,1134194029808291844,2019-05-30,20:25:03,repkimschrier,7,11,19

Let’s be clear: this won’t stop abortions. It will just make them less safe. Abortion is health care. Period. This is a public health crisis and cannot stand. #StopTheBans https://twitter.com/NPR/status/1133422431127912448 …,1133445998188126212,2019-05-28,18:52:39,repkimschrier,16,9,53
