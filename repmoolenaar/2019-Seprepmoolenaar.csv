It was wonderful to join you this morning for this briefing on rare cancers. In my three years on Appropriations there has been strong bipartisan support for more research and we have allocated record funding for the NIH. Thank you for the invitation to join you today! https://twitter.com/beckyruthwatts/status/1174723856969404416 …,1174763271343280129,2019-09-19,19:12:44,repmoolenaar,21,23,20
