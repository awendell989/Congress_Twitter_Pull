"Pleased Democrat leadership finally came to their senses in joining the Republicans in passing the Senate’s bipartisan bill that funds humanitarian assistance at our southern border.

Democrat leadership just denied my unanimous consent request to consider the Senate’s bipartisan bill to provide humanitarian relief at our southern border.
