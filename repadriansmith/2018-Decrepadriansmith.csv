Appreciate @realDonaldTrump & @USTradeRep making progress toward negotiating a trade agreement w/Japan. Reducing trade barriers is beneficial to producers & consumers in both our nations. I look forward to working with the Admin as negotiations progress.  https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2018.12.21_Summary_of_U.S.-Japan_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf …,1076242630906925056,2018-12-21,22:26:53,repadriansmith,166,1,8
"I appreciate @realDonaldTrump keeping his promise to aid American farmers and ranchers as China maintains its tariffs against many of our agricultural products. However, eliminating tariffs and other market access barriers is the only long term solution. @SecretarySonny",1075111097617825793,2018-12-18,19:30:34,repadriansmith,40,6,20
Check out my column this week on our efforts to roll back the Obama Administration's Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule which threatened the productivity of our agricultural producers. https://adriansmith.house.gov/newsroom/columns/continuing-fight-against-wotus …,1074675669718761474,2018-12-17,14:40:20,repadriansmith,14,4,11
Yesterday’s announcement from Texas is further proof Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight with another 20 million people at risk of losing health insurance. Consumers must be empowered to choose the coverage they need. One-size-fits-all mandates from Washington don’t work,1074003800820715520,2018-12-15,18:10:34,repadriansmith,21,0,17

I'm honored to join @RedCross for another year of #HolidaysforHeroes. Thanks to everyone in #Nebraska's Third District who dropped off holiday cards at my district offices for the men and women of our #ArmedForces who will spend the holidays away from their families. pic.twitter.com/vCZ4Q3okli,1072899580235259904,2018-12-12,17:02:48,repadriansmith,0,1,7
The Farm Bill conference report provides for a strong crop insurance program and creates a vaccine bank to help contain future incidents of disease. Nebraska’s producers have made clear they need the certainty of a long term Farm Bill and I look forward to its passage this week. pic.twitter.com/RKHjRqOElY,1072606610684555264,2018-12-11,21:38:38,repadriansmith,2,5,12
"I appreciate @POTUS + @EPA taking action to roll back onerous 2015 #WOTUS regulations which were a gross overreach by the federal government. Farmers, ranchers, and state officials are willing and able to protect their non-navigable waters. This decision honors that commitment.",1072595096556711936,2018-12-11,20:52:53,repadriansmith,0,2,14

Great to hear the White House announce a very positive step forward with China last night after its president agreed to purchase more US agricultural products and negotiate an end to its abuse of American intellectual property in exchange for a delay in tariffs.,1069297575847739397,2018-12-02,18:29:43,repadriansmith,7,6,32
"I’m deeply saddened by the loss of our 41st President, George H. W. Bush. Navy pilot, congressman, ambassador, CIA director, vice president, and president, he was a true public servant and a great man who brought out the best in people.
