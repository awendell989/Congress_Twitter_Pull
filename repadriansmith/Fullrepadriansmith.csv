Today I met with @RFNebraska. We discussed @EPA proposed 2020 RVOs rule. Arbitrary small refinery exemptions – which this rule allows – harm Nebraska’s ethanol industry and threaten the stability and effectiveness of the RFS.,1148645494786314241,2019-07-09,17:30:01,repadriansmith,1,1,4,2019-07-09 17:30:01
The ongoing abuse of small refinery exemptions is damaging RFS integrity. EPA’s proposed 2020 RVOs rule only encourages more of these exemptions. Read my statement here: https://bit.ly/2NFyFoY ,1148577808333058054,2019-07-09,13:01:03,repadriansmith,1,3,8,2019-07-09 13:01:03
