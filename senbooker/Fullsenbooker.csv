The Internet shouldn't belong to big corporations – it should belong to all of us.  #NetNeutrality is the free speech issue of our time. I'm joining @SenMarkey and 40+ senators on the Save The Internet Act of 2019 to finally return the internet to the American people. #SaveTheNet pic.twitter.com/KNSJdaKAuV,1103340564978847745,2019-03-06,17:04:24,senbooker,75,310,1029,2019-03-06 17:04:24
"For too long, millions of Americans & their families have been devastated by a fractured criminal justice system that overwhelmingly hurts people of color, the poor, mentally ill, abused & addicted.

I voted no on Trump's nominee to lead the EPA: Andrew Wheeler. After questioning him in a hearing I have no confidence he will champion the mission of the EPA.
