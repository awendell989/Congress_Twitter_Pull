"It’s disappointing Democrats seem to have rejected this offer even before it was made. I hope they come to their senses. I hope they do so for the Dreamers who contribute to our society, for the 800,000 furloughed workers and most of all for the safety of the American people.",1086754891454914561,2019-01-19,22:38:51,repsmucker,171,115,401,2019-01-19 22:38:51
Our partial shutdown can only end if we are willing to compromise. President Trump is showing again he’s willing to do so. He is being reasonable. He’s making an offer for the Dreamers who have been wrapped up in our country’s immigration problems by no fault of their own.
