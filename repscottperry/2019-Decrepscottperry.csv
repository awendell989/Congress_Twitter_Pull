I took to the House Floor today in opposition to the Articles of Impeachment. Madison and Hamilton warned us about this; that impeachment would veer toward political factions.  That’s exactly what this is - bitterly and nakedly partisan. pic.twitter.com/x5QZYg1kWD,1207422755202830336,2019-12-18,22:09:52,repscottperry,155,368,1214

The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee just said that foreign-policy must be left to the “professionals.” Heaven forbid the President thinks he can be involved in foreign-policy! Do you think the “professionals” will be accountable in any election?,1205234355364335617,2019-12-12,21:13:57,repscottperry,61,46,130
Democrats apparently don’t understand and refuse to accept the legitimate separation of powers. They weren’t willing to go to court but they are sure willing to abuse their own power and take the law into their own hands.,1205229315467685904,2019-12-12,20:53:55,repscottperry,38,105,402
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are acting as though oversight means the executive branch must bow to the legislative branch. They didn’t feel that way when a President said he would use his pen and a phone.,1205229209054072832,2019-12-12,20:53:30,repscottperry,12,13,23
"Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are telling you that if a President doesn’t help them railroad him, then he must be guilty of anything for which he’s accused. Aren’t you happy the judicial system doesn’t treat you that way?",1205228937703514112,2019-12-12,20:52:25,repscottperry,21,15,33
"Democrats on the Judiciary Committee just admitted they can determine what evidence they choose to use to impeach the President. Agreed. Republicans just think impeachment ought to be based on High Crimes and Misdemeanors, not because Dems don’t like the President.",1205228741644959745,2019-12-12,20:51:38,repscottperry,16,10,19

"Before his testimony today, Jonathan Turley - Democrat - noted that Schiff’s public hearings failed to provide a complete picture and “conflicted on critical points.” Do you wonder why Democrats didn’t call HIM as their own witness?",1202259625132863488,2019-12-04,16:13:26,repscottperry,97,500,1713
