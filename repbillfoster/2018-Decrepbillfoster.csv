"ICYMI: the #TrumpShutdown could adversely affect scientific research. Innovation & discovery require sustained federal funding. When @realDonaldTrump fails to lead, we risk losing new medical treatments & new technology that could fight #climatechange. https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/12/28/disruptive-disappointing-chaotic-shutdown-upends-scientific-research/ …",1079019373115920384,2018-12-29,14:20:40,repbillfoster,16,19,39

I introduced a bill to close the Congressional gym during a government shutdown. @SpeakerRyan continues to use it during the #TrumpShutdown as federal workers face uncertainty over the holidays. The only task we have right now is ending the #TrumpShutdown. https://bit.ly/2rTIYrP ,1076860214262067200,2018-12-23,15:20:56,repbillfoster,1046,141,369
The #TrumpShutdown is unnecessary. I am ready to support an agreement that funds the government and does not waste resources on a border wall. https://foster.house.gov/media/press-releases/foster-statement-on-government-shutdown …,1076491765392330752,2018-12-22,14:56:51,repbillfoster,63,10,53

"I opposed this bill because any funding for a border wall is a waste of resources that are better spent on other priorities like education and infrastructure.

Any funding for a border wall is a colossal waste of resources. That’s money we could use to fund new infrastructure projects and new schools. We all agree we need to fix our broken immigration system but threatening to shut down the government isn’t the way to get things done. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1075054037245014017 …,1075103679206907904,2018-12-18,19:01:06,repbillfoster,13,3,24
