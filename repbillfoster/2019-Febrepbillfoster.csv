"I was proud to vote for commonsense legislation to #EndGunViolence this week in Washington. Nearly 40,000 Americans lose their lives each year because of gun violence. Enough is enough. #HR8 and #HR1112 are good first steps to improving our background check system.",1101172548325306368,2019-02-28,17:29:28,repbillfoster,8,13,57
I will vote to block @realDonaldTrump’s national emergency tonight. His declaration is an egregious abuse of presidential power. There is no national security emergency on our southern border and no need for a wasteful border wall. #FakeEmergency https://twitter.com/nytgraphics/status/1100511944950407170 …,1100522676773404673,2019-02-26,22:27:07,repbillfoster,7,7,66

The #FakeTrumpEmergency is a gross and egregious abuse of presidential power that circumvents Congressional authority and sets a dangerous precedent for our democracy. Let's be clear: there is no national security emergency on our southern border. https://bit.ly/2BF04z0 ,1096454964690518016,2019-02-15,17:03:29,repbillfoster,42,170,402

Science and scientific research benefit immensely when everyone has a seat at the table or a place in a laboratory.
