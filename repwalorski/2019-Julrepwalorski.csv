Robocalls have been a nuisance to Hoosiers for too long. The House passed an important measure to crack down on illegal scammers and #robocalls and empower the FCC to impose tougher penalties on those who violate the law. https://thehill.com/policy/technology/454446-house-passes-anti-robocall-bill …,1154821639932141568,2019-07-26,18:31:49,repwalorski,4,1,5

Thanks to @ShopFloorNAM for your strong leadership and advocacy for Hoosier manufacturers.

Janus Motorcycles in Goshen is a great Hoosier manufacturer that showcased its #MadeInAmerica products at the White House today.

Congress’ most important responsibility is to provide for the national defense and support our brave men and women in uniform. The #NDAA passed by the House today falls short of these goals and breaks a longstanding tradition of bipartisan cooperation. http://walorski.house.gov/hr2500-ndaa-partisan-bill …,1149774626240774146,2019-07-12,20:16:47,repwalorski,3,16,7
