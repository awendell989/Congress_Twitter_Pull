Here‚Äôs an update on the situation at the MDC. Thanks to @BilldeBlasio and @nycoem blankets and hand warmers and generators are on the way to prison.  Just because you‚Äôre  incarcerated does not mean that we don‚Äôt treat you with dignity & respect.  Heat & hot water is not a luxury,1091861661907124224,2019-02-03,00:51:20,repjerrynadler,240,1384,4712
"@NydiaVelazquez and I just spoke with BOP Acting Administrator again, and we are attempting to get the agency to accept emergency assistance. Thank you to Federal Defenders, and the activists, reporters for keeping the spotlight on this injustice.",1091803676337938432,2019-02-02,21:00:55,repjerrynadler,3,10,34
I will be demanding that BOP get the contractors back on site immediately.  The lack of urgency in addressing this crisis is inhumane.  I will be talking to Acting BOP Administrator Hurwitz this afternoon.  This is unacceptable.,1091787700364029953,2019-02-02,19:57:26,repjerrynadler,30,182,546
The MDC has only partial heat and electricity. The electrical contractor is not at the facility.  There is a general lack of urgency from the prison officials.,1091787353012797440,2019-02-02,19:56:04,repjerrynadler,29,249,448

I have spoken with BOP Acting Director Hurwitz and am enroute to tour the MDC. I‚Äôm outraged it has taken this level of attention for BOP to take action to prevent detainees from freezing to death.,1091758503696523266,2019-02-02,18:01:25,repjerrynadler,90,761,2449
I will be outside the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) Brooklyn in Sunset Park this afternoon at 1pm with @NydiaVelazquez to demand immediate action by BOP to ensure the health and safety of prisoners being kept in freezing cold conditions without proper heat or electricity. https://twitter.com/NYTMetro/status/1091449362394288131¬†‚Ä¶,1091716444876881921,2019-02-02,15:14:18,repjerrynadler,50,365,1035
"There is no excuse and zero justification for this. Such offensive, morally outrageous behavior is simply unacceptable. Governor Northham should resign. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1091449852540739585¬†‚Ä¶",1091700095396048896,2019-02-02,14:09:20,repjerrynadler,57,125,601
Detainees and staff deserve heat - and the Bureau of Prisons needs to provide answers. I‚Äôve asked the agency for more information. https://twitter.com/NYTMetro/status/1091449362394288131¬†‚Ä¶,1091473622181515264,2019-02-01,23:09:24,repjerrynadler,6,75,173
