"Important leg to help taxi drivers buried under enormous & predatory debt. NYC inflated the price of taxi medallions, relying on lenders that defrauded mostly immigrants & POC with one-sided terms. We have to help these people get back their piece of the American dream. https://twitter.com/repgregorymeeks/status/1218179707042222080 …",1218205537835372545,2020-01-17,16:16:48,repjerrynadler,67,83,364
"The passage of the Equal Rights Amendment—and its guarantee of legal equality to women—is decades overdue. With Virginia's ratification, 38 states have now voiced the need for an amendment that enshrines and strengthens the rights of women in the Constitution.
