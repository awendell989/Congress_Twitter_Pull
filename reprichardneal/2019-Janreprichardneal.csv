Thank you @RepGwenMoore for sharing your personal story today. We need to continue to embrace policies that protect people with pre-existing conditions so that they can get and keep coverage - no matter what. https://twitter.com/RepGwenMoore/status/1090305124470276102 …,1090339155119431680,2019-01-29,20:01:26,reprichardneal,6,12,23
"We need to embrace policies that protect people w pre-existing conditions. I have seen in MA that we can work together across party lines to protect families from financial ruin. We need more of that in Congress, and I hope this hearing will be the beginning of that process. https://twitter.com/WaysMeansCmte/status/1090329427005882368 …",1090329971036442626,2019-01-29,19:24:57,reprichardneal,7,8,42

The national economy has suffered & people have been denied essential govt services during a shutdown they did not want. I will continue to work with my colleagues to find an agreement that is permanent and includes a frank discussion about border security.,1088912571728580608,2019-01-25,21:32:42,reprichardneal,11,5,23
"While I am pleased that a compromise has been reached today, this needless shutdown went on 35 days longer than necessary. For over a month, 800k federal employees have missed paychecks and experienced financial hardship during the longest shutdown in our nation’s history.",1088912393588166656,2019-01-25,21:32:00,reprichardneal,8,6,45
