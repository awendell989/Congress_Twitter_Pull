"Public employees like firefighters, teachers, and police officers should not miss out on the #SocialSecurity benefits they earned over decades of hard work. With this legislation, these valued members of our communities will have greater retirement security and peace of mind.",1177603837538029573,2019-09-27,15:20:08,reprichardneal,19,8,21
"NEWS: This morning I introduced legislation to fix the Windfall Elimination Provision (#WEP) & improve public employees' retirement security. WEP negatively affects nearly 2 million retired public servants across the country, including about 73,000 in MA. https://bit.ly/2nPF989 ",1177603775474950144,2019-09-27,15:19:53,reprichardneal,33,16,35
"TY @repjohnlewis for holding a @WaysMeansCmte hearing this AM on the public health consequences & costs of gun violence. The residual effects include costs for individuals, families, communities & health care providers.

I strongly back Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s call today for a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The American people expect truth and transparency from their government. https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/pelosi-announce-formal-impeachment-inquiry-trump-n1058251 …,1176635507381547014,2019-09-24,23:12:20,reprichardneal,585,2689,16110
I agree with @RepDanKildee. People in Michigan and Massachusetts and across our country shouldn't have to worry if their water is contaminated. I am proud to stand with him in urging lawmakers to keep #PFAS provisions in the #NDAA. https://twitter.com/RepDanKildee/status/1176515141942349824 …,1176522572931973124,2019-09-24,15:43:34,reprichardneal,11,17,63
We must continue the fight to #LowerDrugCosts because American families should not have to choose between paying the bills or paying for medicine. Here's a recap of how @WaysMeansCmte has been addressing this important issue. https://www.modernhealthcare.com/opinion-editorial/paying-healthcare-shouldnt-bankrupt-families …,1176502770771333121,2019-09-24,14:24:53,reprichardneal,11,8,19
Proud to partner with @SpeakerPelosi on this bill to #LowerDrugCosts. People make unthinkable sacrifices just to afford medications they need to stay alive & that shouldn't be the case. Our bill has teeth to ensure patients come first. https://nyti.ms/2AxVAcg ,1175084943266983936,2019-09-20,16:30:57,reprichardneal,29,22,49
It was good to welcome my friend Senator Mark Daly of Ireland to the Capitol today. He brought a copy of the plaque commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising that will be now on permanent display in the Washington Monument. It was good to work with him on this important initiative. pic.twitter.com/hWOwZR7rdk,1174808628227989505,2019-09-19,22:12:58,reprichardneal,12,2,37
"Today’s hearing is a very somber one, but also a very important one.  Hate is becoming mainstream in this country and that must end. I want to thank @repjohnlewis for holding this hearing.  You have spent your life working to eradicate hate, and I sincerely thank you for that.",1174687436343009281,2019-09-19,14:11:24,reprichardneal,40,101,444
"Our Tax Code is also no place for hate.  Groups that propagate white supremacy, anti-Semitism, and hatred for the LGBTQ community, among others, do not deserve a government subsidy through tax exemption.  Hate is not charitable, and it is not educational.",1174687034755178496,2019-09-19,14:09:48,reprichardneal,7,14,39
"We need to lead by example, and that requires us not only to reject, but to condemn outright, hate in all of its forms.  Racism, misogyny, xenophobia—they have no place here.  America is no place for hate.",1174686960105000960,2019-09-19,14:09:30,reprichardneal,4,11,23

In honor of #ConstitutionDay2019 and #CitizenshipDay2019 I met with students and faculty at @WNEUniversity for a discussion on the supreme law of the land and how we can encourage and support those looking to become citizens of our great country. pic.twitter.com/6uUdGXm8Zl,1174019741637382144,2019-09-17,17:58:13,reprichardneal,4,2,8
Great news for the cities of Holyoke and Easthampton! Today I had the pleasure of announcing that both fire departments received DHS grants to hire more firefighters and purchase new equipment. Congratulations to both department. pic.twitter.com/kVDTHNUS3y,1172615459923009536,2019-09-13,20:58:06,reprichardneal,12,4,30
Happy #LaborDay to hard-working laborers and families across our country. They are the backbone of our economy and have fought tirelessly for the workers' rights that we are able to enjoy today and everyday. pic.twitter.com/NbYbu8ERF8,1168504596567855105,2019-09-02,12:43:00,reprichardneal,22,22,66
