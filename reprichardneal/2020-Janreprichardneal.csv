"The House had another successful week passing bipartisan legislation that protects older Americans against age discrimination. But once again, that bill and almost 300 others is stuck in the Senate awaiting a vote.

I recently met with @RepJenniffer and know how critical this funding is for #PuertoRico. The Administration should be doing all it can to help our fellow Americans as they continue to recover. https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/15/trump-to-lift-hold-on-82b-in-puerto-rico-disaster-aid-099139 …,1217523668827410432,2020-01-15,19:07:17,reprichardneal,2,9,24

I was thrilled to be with students from across New England (& NY) at @AIConcampus this weekend for the 80th Annual Model Congress.

This attack represents a serious escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Iran and has put our brave service members at risk. I urge the Trump admin & Iranian govt to take a step back from the brink & exercise restraint to prevent a further intensification of hostilities. https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/1214698718445920258 …,1214730106117201921,2020-01-08,02:06:40,reprichardneal,27,51,202

Last night’s deadly airstrikes in Iraq that targeted high-level Iranian military officials & killed Iran's top security and intelligence commander Qassem Soleimani was done without an AUMF or the consultation of Congress. That is simply unacceptable. https://neal.house.gov/press-releases/neal-statement-airstrike-iraq-against-high-level-iranian-military-officials …,1213136991983939586,2020-01-03,16:36:12,reprichardneal,16,27,54
