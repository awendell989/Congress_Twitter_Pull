"For a man obsessed with the stock market, Trump's latest threat to close the border shows a remarkable level of ignorance.  Closing the border to our third largest trading partner will only further damage his faltering economy and exacerbate the humanitarian crisis he has created",1078780174764773377,2018-12-28,22:30:11,repjuanvargas,13,12,63

This devastating loss of life was undoubtedly preventable had the child been given the necessary medical attention she so desperately needed. We will not allow this to happen again. (3/3),1073745536514179072,2018-12-15,01:04:19,repjuanvargas,3,5,15

There is a difference between improving border security and a building wall at the expense of the American people. The President’s promise of a government shutdown is reckless and wrong. https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1072544085548908546 …,1072624021076918272,2018-12-11,22:47:49,repjuanvargas,4,3,12
