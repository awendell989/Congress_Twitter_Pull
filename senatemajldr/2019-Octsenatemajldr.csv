"Senate Democrats just voted to filibuster the annual funding for the U.S. armed forces. It’s the second time they have blocked defense funding in two months. We can’t advance it.

Remember when Democrats said their impeachment obsession wouldn't stop them from legislating?",1189982177309724673,2019-10-31,19:07:14,senatemajldr,17021,21448,45194
"House Democrats’ impeachment resolution would just codify their unfair process. Here’s what it contemplates:

1. No due process now
2. Maybe some later
3. But only if they feel like it

No American, the president or anyone else, should be subjected to this kind of unfairness.",1189609976760848385,2019-10-30,18:28:15,senatemajldr,20195,16450,42630
Waivers from Obamacare regulations have already helped states bring down premiums and restore options for Americans. Both red states and blue states have used them. Senate Republicans support protections for pre-existing conditions and oppose Democrats' efforts to reduce choice.,1189234821068804097,2019-10-29,17:37:30,senatemajldr,2521,608,1656

"Ironically, the defense funding that Democrats are threatening to block includes $250M for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, the exact same program over which Democrats are attempting to impeach the president.

Funding the military is a critical responsibility. Democrats should not hold up funding for our servicemembers and their vital missions for the sake of picking a fight with the White House.,1189211413895680000,2019-10-29,16:04:30,senatemajldr,572,844,2668

Everyone knows that some House Democrats made up their minds long ago and have been dead-set on impeachment for years. That does not eliminate their responsibility to conduct a fair process that follows precedent and due process when trying to undo a democratic election.,1187464097937477632,2019-10-24,20:21:17,senatemajldr,1749,575,1630

House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is breaking critical precedents. It is denying the administration important rights that past presidents were afforded.

Some of the Democrats criticizing the administration today wanted to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan just a few months ago. They can’t have this both ways. We need clarity: Which Senators support American leadership in the fight against terrorism and which do not?,1186719691642998784,2019-10-22,19:03:17,senatemajldr,2042,381,1245

The Trump administration rightly killed this terrible policy. But now Senate Democrats want to revive it. A whole lot of self-inflicted economic pain for no significant environmental gain. I urge the Senate to reject the Democrats’ resolution later today.,1184852859235508224,2019-10-17,15:25:09,senatemajldr,1198,776,2511

Washington Democrats have been engaged in a three-year-long impeachment parade in search of a rationale. Prominent House Democrats were promising impeachment at the very beginning of this presidency.
