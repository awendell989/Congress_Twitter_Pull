"Many Republicans and I supported a similar rules change when Democrats proposed it during the Obama administration, back in 2013. It passed easily with 78 votes. I hope my Democratic colleagues likewise join with us next week to take this needed step.",1111360210311016448,2019-03-28,20:11:36,senatemajldr,2288,724,3011
Today I took the first step under regular order towards ending systematic obstruction on nominees and getting the Senate back to its normal pattern for handling presidential nominations. https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/remarks/senate-resolution-would-end-systematic-obstruction-on-nominees …,1111360208805289985,2019-03-28,20:11:36,senatemajldr,8493,3348,9467
Thanks @IvankaTrump for visiting @Toyota and its workers in #Kentucky to discuss our economy and workforce. @Toyota continues to be a truly great partner to #Kentucky & we're proud to be the home of its largest vehicle plant in the world.,1111338240844460039,2019-03-28,18:44:18,senatemajldr,951,655,4137
So out of the ash heap of history came this talk of “court-packing.” A radical proposal that had been dead and buried by bipartisan consensus for almost a century.,1111276954953617410,2019-03-28,14:40:47,senatemajldr,3718,1224,4972

Senate Democrats introduced a bill yesterday that would rewrite the rules of politics to benefit their party. Some are even talking about “packing” the Supreme Court.,1111276868626513920,2019-03-28,14:40:26,senatemajldr,1031,666,1871
My home state of Kentucky and many other states are bearing heavy burdens in the wake of powerful natural disasters. The Senate is currently considering a package of supplemental disaster relief funds to address the most urgent needs of America’s heartland.,1111276087278006274,2019-03-28,14:37:20,senatemajldr,1170,211,1098

And they’ll see which senators are so fully committed to radical left-wing ideology that they can’t even vote “no” on self-inflicted economic ruin that would take a sledgehammer to America’s middle class.,1110557589731983360,2019-03-26,15:02:17,senatemajldr,1692,781,3340

It’s remarkable to see a party coalesce around a proposal to forcibly remake the entire country on the whims of Brooklyn and San Francisco. But it’s been even more stunning to see my Democrat colleagues angry and upset that the plan they support is about to get a vote.,1110557586858885120,2019-03-26,15:02:16,senatemajldr,431,359,1179
"The Green New Deal, my Democratic colleagues’ rallying cry: Killing off entire domestic industries. Winding down millions of jobs.

So I am troubled that leading Democrats seem to have some difficulty plainly calling out anti-semitism within their own ranks. And I am troubled that many of the declared Democrat presidential candidates seem to be avoiding @AIPAC this year.,1110535969768382466,2019-03-26,13:36:22,senatemajldr,1392,1496,5496
"It may be that anti-semitic views are limited to a small fringe today. But if ancient slurs and sanders are left unchallenged, they will be normalized anew.",1110535968883437570,2019-03-26,13:36:22,senatemajldr,1289,1647,6212
"Remember, to the Mullahs in Tehran, the United States and Israel are the “Great Satan” and “Little Satan.”
Our enemies group us together because we are cut from similar cloth. And frankly that should be a point of pride for all of us.",1110535091359490048,2019-03-26,13:32:53,senatemajldr,391,279,1068
"Supporting Israel is not some conspiracy, or part of some hidden agenda supported by money and ""dual loyalties"".

No collusion. No conspiracy. No obstruction. It’s good news that we can conclusively set aside the notion that the president and his team had somehow participated in Russia’s interference in our electoral process. https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/remarks/no-collusion-no-conspiracy-no-obstruction …,1110289835158315008,2019-03-25,21:18:19,senatemajldr,23393,2330,7658

"Apparently, Democrats think seniors want Medicare hollowed out until nothing’s left but the name.

Nothing encapsulates the Democrat’s hard left turn towards socialism more than the “Green New Deal”. One estimate pegs the cost of this centrally-planned nightmare at around $93 trillion.
