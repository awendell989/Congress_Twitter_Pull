This amendment would be a radical departure from constitutional traditions and norms. It would weaken American deterrence and diplomacy at a time of heightened tensions caused by Iran’s aggression in the Middle East. The Senate must defeat it.,1144608545817726977,2019-06-28,14:08:37,senatemajldr,1183,552,2096

I’m glad our House colleagues passed the Senate’s bipartisan funding bill for the humanitarian crisis on our southern border. I just signed off on this badly-needed legislation and now it’s finally on its way to the President’s desk. pic.twitter.com/YID2UL00zZ,1144375005440094210,2019-06-27,22:40:37,senatemajldr,2414,1694,7814
The need for humanitarian funding is drastic. The House should pass the overwhelmingly bipartisan Senate Bill as quickly as possible and finally provide this badly overdue emergency border funding. https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/research/a-tale-of-two-bills …,1144280844670066688,2019-06-27,16:26:27,senatemajldr,631,485,1993
House Democrats have had eight weeks to pass emergency border funding. All they could pass was a partisan bill that failed in the Senate. The Senate’s bill is overwhelmingly bipartisan and what can be signed into law.,1144279850653560833,2019-06-27,16:22:30,senatemajldr,3057,3223,13036
