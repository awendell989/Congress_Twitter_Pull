2016 saw the most ballots ever cast in a presidential election. The 2018 midterms had the highest turnout in 50 years. And 92 percent of surveyed voters told the Pew Research Center their voting experience was “very easy” or “somewhat easy”. http://www.people-press.org/2018/12/17/most-voters-have-positive-views-of-their-midterm-voting-experiences/ …,1091019202805276672,2019-01-31,17:03:42,senatemajldr,1502,474,1344
