I’ll be on @CNBC’s @SquawkAlley at 11:10am EDT talking about the U.S. economy and why House Democrats need  to stop blocking the USMCA. Tune in.,1178676980776099841,2019-09-30,14:24:25,senatemajldr,2507,472,1597
"The USMCA would create 176,000 jobs for American workers and generate $68 billion in wealth for America. House Democrats must stop standing in its way.

I’m proud the Appropriations Committee advanced my legislation to increase funding for the Countering Russian Influence Fund and to expand democracy promotion in Hong Kong. Russian and Chinese aggression are two of the major threats facing our nation. https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/mcconnell-provisions-on-russia-and-hong-kong-included-in-appropriations-legislation …,1177342839480602626,2019-09-26,22:03:01,senatemajldr,5519,6108,11249
The time for excuses is over. The USMCA needs to move this fall. Workers and small businesses in Kentucky and across the nation need this deal. The United States of America needs this deal. Only House Democrats are standing in the way.,1177253334891278342,2019-09-26,16:07:22,senatemajldr,5844,8655,26384
"176,000 new American jobs. Tens of billions in new prosperity. Stronger relationships with two of our closest allies in the face of China’s aggressive economic policies.

Senate Democrats should not create a false choice between border security and military construction. They may oppose the administration’s border security agenda but they certainly shouldn’t punish our armed forces.,1176873427661205504,2019-09-25,14:57:45,senatemajldr,3844,1947,7208

Our nation must continue investing in the readiness and modernization of our military. Russia and China aren’t slowing down to wait for us.

Some Democrats are also threatening to “pack” the Supreme Court if they don’t get the rulings they want. These attacks on judicial independence are not normal politics.
