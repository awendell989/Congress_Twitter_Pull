"BREAKING: The Senate just passed the USMCA. Next stop: @POTUS’s desk for his signature.

"Yesterday, the Speaker celebrated impeachment with souvenir pens, bearing her own golden signature, brought in on silver platters.

The framers built the Senate to break these kinds of partisan fevers. To stabilize our institutions and protect our country. To stop short-term passions from destroying our long-term future. That is the Senate's duty. That is what we must do when this trial begins.,1217613653983272960,2020-01-16,01:04:51,senatemajldr,2780,3718,12347
"Democrats’ impeachment has been nakedly partisan from the beginning. Pelosi admits it was in the making years before events with Ukraine. Schumer says that whatever happens, if it helps him politically, it’s a “win-win.” They are playing political games with the Constitution.",1217613653106679808,2020-01-16,01:04:51,senatemajldr,8757,13447,40032
These two things cannot both be true. Is House Democrats’ case so “overwhelming” that it was enough to impeach a president? Or is their case so weak and incomplete that they need the Senate to redo it? They can’t even stick to one story.,1217552859052630016,2020-01-15,21:03:17,senatemajldr,1838,3875,11294

"We’ve reached a simple contradiction. The House case cannot be so robust that it was enough to rush into impeachment, and enough for Senate Democrats to start pre-judging guilt, but also so weak that they need the Senate to go fishing.

"First, Democrats spent weeks saying the House case was totally convincing. Now, the opposite: They say the House case is so thin that if the Senate judges what the House actually voted on, it's a “cover-up.""

It should not take brave Iranians to remind American leaders that Tehran has been a force for bad and the United States is a force for good. I hope this can be a lesson to those who’ve let domestic political grievances pollute their judgment. https://bit.ly/35Mc6md ,1216893148686843904,2020-01-14,01:21:50,senatemajldr,1288,2951,9802

I’m glad the Speaker may finally be realizing she never had any “leverage” to dictate Senate procedure to Senators.

This is a challenging time to create bipartisan agreement. But the Speaker Pelosi has managed to do the impossible. She has created growing bipartisan unity — in opposition to her own reckless games with impeachment.,1215311290996006919,2020-01-09,16:36:05,senatemajldr,5271,9435,33829
