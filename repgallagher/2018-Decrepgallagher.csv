".@SecPompeo deserves enormous credit for today’s announcement. Not only are we moving forward on INF in a way that makes clear Russia is the party acting in bad faith, but we are doing so in close coordination with our @NATO allies.

"Great piece by @OswaldRachel on Congressional dysfunction. I spoke to her about how devolving power back to committees is key to getting Congress working again. In order to wield power effectively, you have to be willing to give some of it up. https://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/congress-waits-for-reboot …",1069994266443857920,2018-12-04,16:38:07,repgallagher,1,6,6
We cannot be complacent about Hezbollah's growing arsenal. It's time to pass my bipartisan legislation with @RepTomSuozzi sanctioning Hezbollah for its inhumane use of human shields. https://twitter.com/JSchanzer/status/1069616657671180290 …,1069646492414160902,2018-12-03,17:36:11,repgallagher,10,48,98
"I’ve always admired my predecessor @RepRibble's willingness to standup to pressure and challenge conventional wisdom. He joined me for a convo on what it’s like to deal with that pressure, and what it’s going to take to fix the broken process through which Congress operates. pic.twitter.com/xw20zVzR0C",1069638893589458945,2018-12-03,17:05:59,repgallagher,17,6,54

"A lot of cool history at the @ReaganDefense forum. Here’s the original 1987 INF Treaty, which played a key role at the tail end of the Cold War. Since then, things have changed and we’re now effectively in a treaty with ourselves. It’s time to move on. pic.twitter.com/DiX8SlvH3P",1069299517739143170,2018-12-02,18:37:26,repgallagher,18,12,65
"Great conversation today at @ReaganDefense on our technological competition with China. Unfortunately, the private sector and the government seem to be on entirely different pages.
