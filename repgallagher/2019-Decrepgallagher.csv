Great to see the @USMC and Commandant Berger leading the way for the Department to focus relentlessly on implementing the National Defense Strategy. Step one is developing and fielding intermediate-range missiles. There is no time to lose. https://warontherocks.com/2019/12/notes-on-designing-the-marine-corps-of-the-future/ …,1203022562227343360,2019-12-06,18:45:04,repgallagher,18,7,21
Thank you @BudgetHawks for supporting the TRUST Act. @MayaMacGuineas gets it right: Working out our biggest problems is exactly what we should be doing in our democracy. Doing nothing to save our most vital programs should not be an option. https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/473278-statesmen-seek-bipartisan-solutions-to-big-challenges …,1202997115284283395,2019-12-06,17:03:57,repgallagher,15,11,16
Looking forward to heading out to the Reagan National Defense Forum and talking more about the new @ReaganInstitute Task Force report on strengthening our national security innovation base.

"Honored to participate in the Holiday Mail for Heroes program organized by the @RedCross today. Writing cards to deployed service members is a small way we can show our gratitude to these brave men and women, especially during the holiday season. pic.twitter.com/pTZmjjRv0n",1202376033934200837,2019-12-04,23:56:00,repgallagher,13,4,21
We're lucky to have Sam Ravich on the @CyberSolarium Commission. We would all do well to heed her warning about better defending American data from the Chinese Communist Party and its relentless drive for AI superiority. https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-and-the-adversary-11575417680?mod=opinion_lead_pos5 …,1202296450950062083,2019-12-04,18:39:46,repgallagher,12,6,9

"Great news on American leadership from the @ReaganInstitute #DefenseSurvey. Super majorities of Americans support increased defense spending, maintaining bases overseas, and defending our values abroad, including support for Hong Kong.  https://www.reaganfoundation.org/media/355292/reagan-foundation-survey-charts-112519.pdf …",1202227933965963264,2019-12-04,14:07:30,repgallagher,22,11,22
