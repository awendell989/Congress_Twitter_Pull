Every American deserves to have their vote counted AND protected. That’s not what #HR1 would do. #FortheDemocrats,1088485520148254720,2019-01-24,17:15:45,houseadmngop,2,6,6
"“It would make it harder for states to fix inaccurate data in their voter rolls.” By federalizing the voter registration process, Democrats are taking power away from states and are taking over elections. #FortheDemocrats",1088485518667595776,2019-01-24,17:15:45,houseadmngop,2,4,4
"Democrats are “pitching new taxpayer subsidies, including a 600% govt. match for certain political donations and a new voucher program that would funnel even more public dollars to campaigns.” #HR1",1088485517208051713,2019-01-24,17:15:45,houseadmngop,1,4,4
#HR1 is a “proposal to grow the federal government’s power over Americans’ political speech and elections.” #FortheDemocrats,1088485515945488385,2019-01-24,17:15:44,houseadmngop,1,3,4

"The Committee's thoughts and prayers are with our former Chair Candice Miller in this devastating time of the passing of her husband Judge Donald Miller.

The incoming president of the National Association of Secretaries of State calls #HR1 “a huge federal overreach.” https://twitter.com/nationaljournal/status/1083428277623144448 …,1084081006636908544,2019-01-12,13:33:47,houseadmngop,2,2,2
At least now we know who wrote #HR1. Will these outside organizations be briefing the Democrats on their bill’s content soon? #ForTheDemocrats https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1083053821444665347 …,1083133806851301376,2019-01-09,22:49:57,houseadmngop,0,1,1
Questions that should be asked (6): Why didn’t the Members of Congress standing behind the podium write the bill? Isn’t that our job? https://twitter.com/HouseAdmnGOP/status/1081227966443606016 …,1081228152205205504,2019-01-04,16:37:34,houseadmngop,4,2,4
Questions that should be asked (5): Who are the grassroots organizations that wrote this bill? https://twitter.com/HouseAdmnGOP/status/1081224735671926784 …,1081227966443606016,2019-01-04,16:36:50,houseadmngop,1,1,4
Questions that should be asked (4): Is this Speaker Pelosi’s idea of bipartisanship for the 116th Congress? https://twitter.com/HouseAdmnGOP/status/1081224587550052352 …,1081224735671926784,2019-01-04,16:23:59,houseadmngop,38,18,57
"Questions that should be asked (3): If Committee on House Administration has jurisdiction over the focus of the bill, why weren’t the Committee Republicans consulted? https://twitter.com/HouseAdmnGOP/status/1081224230879023104 …",1081224587550052352,2019-01-04,16:23:24,houseadmngop,9,2,3
Questions that should be asked (2): Who wrote everything that is contained in H.R. 1? https://twitter.com/HouseAdmnGOP/status/1081224064600031232 …,1081224230879023104,2019-01-04,16:21:59,houseadmngop,4,2,3
Questions that should be asked: Has anyone at the podium read H.R. 1 or does anyone know what’s in it? https://twitter.com/HouseAdmnGOP/status/1081223794667278342 …,1081224064600031232,2019-01-04,16:21:19,houseadmngop,2,1,3

The new Democratic Majority needs to focus on the actual problems within our election system instead of prematurely pushing a preset agenda with H.R. 1. Our Committee has an obligation to ensure every American’s vote is counted and protected. https://republicans-cha.house.gov/press-release/davis-asks-hearings-review-voting-irregularities …,1081221379956137985,2019-01-04,16:10:39,houseadmngop,27,18,65
