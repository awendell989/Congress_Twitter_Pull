The #SuperBowl is one of the largest human trafficking events of the year. The @DHSBlueCampaign provides important public awareness campaigns and that is why my legislation to authorize this program and codify their efforts was signed into law last year. https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1091020608157167616 …,1091102215421550594,2019-01-31,22:33:34,repmccaul,170,378,1377
"""Human trafficking is the barbaric practice of profiting in people, a form of slavery we assumed had been assigned to the ash heap of history.

.@SharkWeek fans: I introduced legislation w/ @Kilili_Sablan to ban shark fin sales in the United States. The gruesome shark-finning practices are decimating global shark populations and putting many species on the brink of extinction.

I fought passionately for this funding following #Harvey & I remain committed to ensuring it’s used as intended — for Army Corps projects to mitigate future flooding disasters.
