Today—for the 15th time—the hearing for the #CITGO6 was inexplicably postponed because the court decided it was not in session. This is unacceptable. The CITGO executives being illegally detained by Maduro must be immediately released. #ItsTime to #BringOurGuysHome!,1121866673726816256,2019-04-26,20:00:32,repmccaul,6,8,17
