The attorney general’s letter makes clear there are still unanswered questions about obstruction of justice in Special Counsel Mueller’s report. This makes it all the more urgent that Congress and the American people understand Mr. Mueller's findings from the report itself.

Our hearts are broken for those mourning the 49 fallen in the Christchurch mosque murders and for the global community who is witnessing another callous loss of life.

Is this bill perfect? No. But overall this legislation improves how our country performs its most critical work. #HR1 (14/14),1103828960251727877,2019-03-08,01:25:06,repkendrahorn,8,5,27
"The bill would create nonpartisan, independent commissions for each state. You’re supposed to choose us, not the other way around. We shouldn’t let politicians pick and choose which voters get to elect them. #HR1 (13/)",1103828646354132993,2019-03-08,01:23:52,repkendrahorn,3,14,53

This bill would make sure that you can know who is paying for ads you see on TV or Facebook or Twitter. That Is often a secret now! This would keep foreign-controlled companies from making large donations. #HR1 (11/),1103828315910144003,2019-03-08,01:22:33,repkendrahorn,3,6,25
"I don’t see that requirement as a burden. I’m happy to disclose our donors and expenditures. Dark money groups don’t have to tell you where they got their money, who gave it to them or how they spent it. They shouldn’t get special protections. #HR1 (10/)",1103828150449070083,2019-03-08,01:21:53,repkendrahorn,1,4,20

"We must also ensure our voting systems are secure. Although OK's voter access could improve, our system sets an example for the rest of the country. It is consistent statewide, uses easy-to-read paper ballots and machines that have never been connected to the internet. #HR1 (7/)",1103827617017401344,2019-03-08,01:19:46,repkendrahorn,3,4,22

"Our laws create unnecessary burdens. In OK, we require a notary on all absentee ballots. Our state has no history of absentee ballot fraud. In other states, punishments don’t fit crimes; laws revoke the right to vote even after sentences are completed. #HR1 (5/)",1103826917654974467,2019-03-08,01:16:59,repkendrahorn,5,5,20
"I just got back from the Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage, where we toured some of the most pivotal sites in our nation’s civil rights history.

"Here is a highlight of what I think is most important. It makes registering to vote easier. It ensures our elections are more secure. It shines a light on outside groups and their money in Washington. And it ensures you pick us, not the other way around. #HR1 (3/)",1103826023014109184,2019-03-08,01:13:26,repkendrahorn,3,5,18
"There is literally nothing more important that we can and should do than ensuring our democracy is protected. The foundation of everything we do – national security, education, everything – is our democratic system.
