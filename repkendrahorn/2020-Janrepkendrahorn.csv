Great to be at @kfor & @KOCOnews this morning to talk about our Civil Rights & Justice Town Hall tomorrow at Fairview Baptist Church from 1-3pm.

"As we approach MLK Day, it's critical we pause to acknowledge those who fought & continue to fight for justice.

"Great news! The Senate just passed the bipartisan USMCA trade deal! Stronger trading relationships with our neighbors mean a stronger economy for OK workers, businesses, and families. Today’s win is another example of what we can accomplish when both parties work together.",1217869166167973890,2020-01-16,18:00:10,repkendrahorn,27,8,77
Americans hold $1.6 trillion in student debt. We still need action to reduce the cost of higher ed and we must tackle the student debt crisis. Today’s bill is a first step to help students defrauded by for-profit colleges and to hold predatory institutions accountable.,1217847368600686593,2020-01-16,16:33:33,repkendrahorn,9,3,79
"For too long, predatory colleges have cheated U.S. students. Now, Devos is proposing a rule making it harder for students to seek relief. Today the House took action to stop that rule from going into effect.",1217847364502900736,2020-01-16,16:33:32,repkendrahorn,3,5,84
Never before has there been a Secretary of Education who cares so little for our students. Betsy Devos has actively worked to block student debt relief measures for those defrauded by for-profit colleges. Today the House is taking action to protect students from Devos’ policies.,1217847361382293509,2020-01-16,16:33:32,repkendrahorn,46,80,544
Many harmful tariffs are still in place. It’s going to take time to recover from the trade war of the past two years. Trade decisions should be focused on providing certainty and promoting economic competitiveness not partisan politics.,1217589636299722752,2020-01-15,23:29:25,repkendrahorn,15,3,18
I am cautiously optimistic that the #PhaseOne trade deal represents a step forward for the OK businesses and consumers hurt by the trade war. For too long China cheated US companies with unfair practices like forced tech transfers. This is a first step towards free & fair trade.,1217589635251167232,2020-01-15,23:29:25,repkendrahorn,22,5,45
Today I introduced legislation to rename the downtown post office as the Clara Luper Post Office. The historic sit-ins led by Luper and the NAACP Youth Council changed Oklahoma and inspired desegregation actions across the South. We must remember and celebrate our proud history. pic.twitter.com/6BhBLeu0n9,1217203323310395395,2020-01-14,21:54:21,repkendrahorn,33,72,447
As the Congresswoman representing #OK5 I'm proud to be a voice for all Oklahomans. That means listening to people's concerns and taking action on issues important to our state.

There’s a right and wrong way to keep a check on the Administration and make long-term national security decisions. Partisan politics is the wrong way. Using our constitutional authority to set clear & strategic boundaries about how and when Armed Forces are used is the right way,1215803739073847296,2020-01-11,01:12:54,repkendrahorn,13,2,30
"I want to see both parties work together to pass an updated Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). The AUMF defines where and when Armed Forces can be used, but the last time Congress passed an AUMF was in 2002. We must update to account for current security threats.",1215803737878532096,2020-01-11,01:12:54,repkendrahorn,3,5,27
"As tensions with Iran escalate, my priority is protecting the long-term security of Americans.

My vote this week on the War Powers Resolution was not a go-ahead for the President to engage in a military conflict. My vote was against a resolution more focused on partisan politics than the best interest of our national security.,1215803734732746754,2020-01-11,01:12:53,repkendrahorn,89,19,104

"PFAS are toxic, man-made chemicals. They're often called ""forever chemicals"" because they persistent in the environment and accumulate in our bodies.

There’s no question that Soleimani was a threat to the U.S. and that he was responsible for the death of hundreds of Americans. But are Americans safer now than before Soleimani was killed?
