"It's been a week since President Trump shut the government down. Until he understands that the right choice is the American people and not the ineffective border wall, it does not appear this #TrumpShutdown will end. https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/House-lawmakers-on-Partial-Govt-Shutdown-503575171.html …",1078691292304019461,2018-12-28,16:36:59,repebj,4,4,9

"Democrats presented Pres. Trump with a simple proposal days ago: keep the government funded through a bipartisan plan that provided more than $1 billion for border security. Pres.

House Democrats and Senators from both parties are ready to keep the government open. The Senate has already voted to do so. If the government does indeed shutdown it will be because POTUS rejected a bipartisan deal. #TrumpShutdown,1075838790655229952,2018-12-20,19:42:10,repebj,5,7,16
