"The elections in Hong Kong this past weekend were a stunning rebuke of the communist Chinese regime. It's proof that the vast majority of Hong Kong residents believe in, & want to preserve, the democratic freedoms they've had all these years. It's time for Beijing to take notice. pic.twitter.com/QVBX7FOgpJ",1199051200290795522,2019-11-25,19:44:18,sentoomey,720,5016,7152
"Donating food to the hungry should be as easy as possible.

.@CribsForKids has a great mission: provide cribs at little or no cost to help prevent infant deaths. Got word today that @USTradeRep excluded their cribs from China tariffs. I was happy to go to bat for them and other PA businesses hurt by the trade war. http://bit.ly/351DFYQ ,1195112882112995335,2019-11-14,22:54:49,sentoomey,81,6,53

President Trump is right to confront China on its egregious trade practices but tariffs also hurt American workers and consumers. Further proof: a new study showing that 1.5 million American jobs are at risk because of the trade war with China: http://bit.ly/2peCFBt ,1194414188233408514,2019-11-13,00:38:28,sentoomey,200,37,115

Today in Dauphin County I touted 2 measures designed to preserve PA's natural gas industry. The 1st underscores that no president can legally ban fracking on state/private lands. The 2nd aims to curb states like NY's abuse of federal laws to thwart natural gas development. pic.twitter.com/50aTrIcUxL,1192868562857332742,2019-11-08,18:16:42,sentoomey,261,26,105

"The Korean War is often referred to as the “Forgotten War.” This is a shame, as it was American forces that preserved a democratic South Korea.
