.@phillydotcom “…he sexually assaulted a child after being released from local custody in Philadelphia.” Philly’s extreme sanctuary city policy made this crime possible. It’s time to end dangerous sanctuary city policies. http://bit.ly/2T1dK1R ,1100518123789340678,2019-02-26,22:09:02,sentoomey,304,43,138
"A bipartisan majority voted tonight to ensure care is given to infants who survive botched abortions. Sadly, a minority of senators justified blocking the bill by saying it limits access to abortions, which isn’t true.

Encouraging news from @POTUS that progress is being made in a trade deal with China. Hopefully this leads to an agreement that stops China’s theft of US intellectual property and avoids a full blown trade war.,1099811676923326464,2019-02-24,23:21:51,sentoomey,162,26,188
"American consumers have paid $13B billion in tariffs, i.e. taxes, on imported steel/alum, and goods from China. They've doled out another $7.7B to farmers hurt by this trade war.

Inspiring visit with @CityMission1941 in Washington County yesterday. The City Mission is helping to save lives from heroin addiction and give those who’ve fallen on hard times a second chance. https://bit.ly/2T0VLbb ,1098270184941502464,2019-02-20,17:16:31,sentoomey,51,3,17

"#ValentinesDay is the sweetest holiday there is. What's not sweet is the U.S. sugar program, which forces Americans to pay 2X more for sugar than the rest of the world. It's bad for consumers & the 40,000 Pennsylvanians who work in sugar-using industries. We need reforms now. pic.twitter.com/pOOXkJyTIl",1096202757068017664,2019-02-15,00:21:18,sentoomey,83,10,36
