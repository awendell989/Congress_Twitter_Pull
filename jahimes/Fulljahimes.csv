I’m making a process argument not a substantive one. There is plenty to say on substance. And the question of balance is an interesting one but not one we’ve addressed. That doesn’t mean I believe our thinking should be “purely political”.,1120512433565650946,2019-04-23,02:19:16,jahimes,3,1,2,2019-04-23 02:19:16

Advocating with your representative is not ludicrous. It is at the very core of our democracy. Are you arguing that the way forward here is totally obvious? What if someone out there disagrees with you?,1120499021825679360,2019-04-23,01:25:59,jahimes,6,0,4,2019-04-23 01:25:59

There is no explicit duty as there is conduct a census every 10 years. Congress decides if and when to impeach independent of the words of the constitution. That’s not controversial. It’s true. So it’s not unreasonable to try to understand where American sentiment is in deciding.,1120488486124118018,2019-04-23,00:44:07,jahimes,19,1,13,2019-04-23 00:44:07
Lordy. It’s not about a look. Duty is in quotes because the constitution imposes absolutely no obligation to impeach under any circumstance. It’s at the discretion of Congress. Kinda feels like you’re looking for a lot more fireworks than you’re going to find in this quarter.,1120486186571784196,2019-04-23,00:34:59,jahimes,33,1,34,2019-04-23 00:34:59
"Like everything else a legislator does, there’s a mix of “knowing” and what public sentiment demands. Especially in the House, where we are called “Representative”.

"I don’t think there’s an opposition between the two in this case. Impeachment is by design a political act, not a judicial or legal one. So public sentiment is as essential (probably more) as any implicit constitutional “duty”.",1120484036357623808,2019-04-23,00:26:26,jahimes,14,0,18,2019-04-23 00:26:26

"I don’t know what you heard, but I wasn’t forceful about not impeaching Trump (your words).

"No it wasn’t. Jim Himes argued that we should reflect on and consider the effect of impeachment proceedings on the chances of the President’s re-election, without prejudice. Because if he is not convicted by the Senate, 2020 is the next mechanism of accountability.",1120481357459787776,2019-04-23,00:15:47,jahimes,17,2,23,2019-04-23 00:15:47
