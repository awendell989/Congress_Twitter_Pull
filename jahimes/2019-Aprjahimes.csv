I’m making a process argument not a substantive one. There is plenty to say on substance. And the question of balance is an interesting one but not one we’ve addressed. That doesn’t mean I believe our thinking should be “purely political”.,1120512433565650946,2019-04-23,02:19:16,jahimes,3,1,2

There is no explicit duty as there is conduct a census every 10 years. Congress decides if and when to impeach independent of the words of the constitution. That’s not controversial. It’s true.

Lordy. It’s not about a look. Duty is in quotes because the constitution imposes absolutely no obligation to impeach under any circumstance. It’s at the discretion of Congress.
