The President‚Äôs shameful comments about Congressman Cummings make it evident that his bigotry is not going away. We can no longer tolerate it and condemnation by the House of Representatives clearly wasn‚Äôt enough. We must impeach. #ImpeachNow,1155663404985651200,2019-07-29,02:16:41,repalgreen,2302,2810,10119

Yesterday's testimony was evidence of analysis paralysis. We waited 2 years for the Mueller Report and 3 months for Mr. Mueller to testify.
