Today @FSCDems continue to fight #ForThePeople by addressing the broken credit reporting system. Far too many Americans have been the victims of inaccuracies on their credit report that negatively impact their families and access to the American Dream. #WhosKeepingScore,1100428968933707776,2019-02-26,16:14:45,repalgreen,9,12,40
