We are now working through the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee's markup language. Here's an overview of what the subcommittee is and what it covers #FY20NDAA:  https://armedservices.house.gov/seapowerandprojectionforces …,1138829592188338178,2019-06-12,15:25:07,repgaramendi,1,1,1,2019-06-12 15:25:07

We have included all other amendments with broad bipartisan support into the Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee mark through the en bloc process. We've voice voted the mark and are moving on to the next subcommittee's mark.,1138827023361728513,2019-06-12,15:14:55,repgaramendi,1,1,2,2019-06-12 15:14:55

This amendment was withdrawn due to what's called a point of order. Points of order are prohibitions against certain types of legislation or congressional actions. These prohibitions are enforced when a Rep raises a point of order against legislation that may violate these rules,1138825517728223232,2019-06-12,15:08:56,repgaramendi,1,0,1,2019-06-12 15:08:56

Voice voting is the quickest way to vote on something because we don't have to tally each Rep's vote. It's typically used when there's broad consensus on a vote or issue. It is the right of any Rep to request a recorded vote even if a voice vote is proposed.,1138822230148866048,2019-06-12,14:55:52,repgaramendi,1,0,2,2019-06-12 14:55:52
