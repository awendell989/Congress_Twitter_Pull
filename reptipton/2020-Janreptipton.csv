"'Exciting' is hardly the word I would use to describe the state-mandated loss of 500 jobs. It is discouraging to see this forced upon a rural community without a solid plan to replace hundreds, maybe thousands, of jobs that depend on the coal industry in Moffat County. https://twitter.com/JoeStGeorge/status/1217498337613701120Â â€¦",1217501206848864257,2020-01-15,17:38:02,reptipton,15,3,5
Americans have plenty to celebrate today as the U.S. & China agree to Phase One of a larger trade deal. Expanding market access for American-produced products & better protections against intellectual property theft are critical to securing a long-term trade agreement. https://twitter.com/WaysandMeansGOP/status/1217474018565152768Â â€¦,1217498893656608769,2020-01-15,17:28:50,reptipton,8,2,7

"I do not support Nancy Pelosiâ€™s PR campaign to undermine President Trumpâ€™s every action. This non-binding statement is her latest example of her caucusâ€™ incessant quibbling with this administration, this time an attempt to hinder efforts to protect Americans from active threats.",1215413993185120256,2020-01-09,23:24:11,reptipton,40,21,76
"#Iran, a well-known sponsor of terrorism, shot down a civilian-filled aircraft this week killing 176 people.

Farm labor shortages are so bad that some farmers have had to let crops rot in fields because they cannot retain qualified seasonal workers. I appreciate the @DailySentinelGJ editorial board's thoughtful analysis of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act https://www.gjsentinel.com/opinion/editorials/tipton-makes-a-good-call-on-farm-labor/article_81db4446-31aa-11ea-a21d-53e8f3f4f73a.htmlÂ â€¦,1214988795109683202,2020-01-08,19:14:36,reptipton,6,3,4
"We have been more than patient with Iran's hostile actions not only last year, but in the decades of their regimes supporting enemies of the U.S. I am grateful no American casualties have been reported in last night's attack, & I hope Iran's aggressive behavior ends immediately.",1214931345576775680,2020-01-08,15:26:19,reptipton,4,19,16

"For decades, Iran's Ayatollah has exclaimed ""Death to America,"" and backed this evil rhetoric by funding terror groups, killing hundreds of Americans, and further escalating violence in other countries like Syria and Yemen resulting in the deaths of millions more.",1214212608594784256,2020-01-06,15:50:19,reptipton,3,2,8
"#Iran is just as big a threat to America as it was 5 years ago. Almost immediately after signing the ineffective JCPOA, Iran was caught with several violations of the 'deal' and made a full review of their nuclear capabilities nearly impossible.",1214212607554531328,2020-01-06,15:50:19,reptipton,28,8,19
