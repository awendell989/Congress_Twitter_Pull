"Good news for many Sandy victims. 6+ years later, there are homeowners across Long Island still recovering from this devastating storm, and they need our support.

"If President Trump and @HouseGOP actually cared about our security, they would stop obsessing over a useless border wall, they would vote to reopen the government and they would pay the hardworking men and women who keep us safe. The next Congress will do better.",1079027789741854720,2018-12-29,14:54:07,repkathleenrice,15,14,53
"This week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers won’t receive a paycheck. That includes TSA, CBP, FBI & DEA agents, and members of the Coast Guard - the very people who are charged with protecting our homeland.

There's been no accountability for the administration's reckless border policy. And the consequences have been tragic. This glaring neglect cannot continue. There needs to be greater oversight & a thorough investigation. In the next Congress we'll do both. https://nyti.ms/2RfYUD0 ,1078360095342411777,2018-12-27,18:40:56,repkathleenrice,20,10,28

"Remember when the President said he would protect people with pre-existing conditions? That was a lie. His administration supported this lawsuit and now the health care of millions of Americans is at risk.

My thoughts are with the entire Bush family today. President George H. W. Bush was a true public servant and a war hero who dedicated his entire life to serving our country — and he did so in nearly every way imaginable. We owe him a debt of gratitude.
