"Oregon has some of the most sustainably productive fisheries in the world, and that’s in part because of the cooperation between science and industry.

Hard to believe the Milwaukie Rotary members even have time to meet with all the hard work they do. Already this month they’ve led an “Adopt-A-Road” clean up and raised money for a local non-profit through their March Madness Bracket Challenge!

"The Mueller Report is clear that Russia did interfere in our American election process.

I voted for the #SaveTheInternet Act to overturn the FCC’s 2017 order to roll back #NetNeutrality. Oregonians overwhelmingly support enforceable protections to ensure a free & open internet & so do I. Congress must act to codify important #NetNeutrality protections for consumers.,1116005519301447681,2019-04-10,15:50:24,repschrader,2,3,24

This legislation mirrors Oregon’s framework and will also ensure tipped workers are paid the same as non-tipped workers. It has been ten years since Congress raised the federal minimum wage and the time is now.,1114292496824070145,2019-04-05,22:23:28,repschrader,1,2,22
"A $7.25 federal minimum wage is indefensible in this day and age. This week, I co-sponsored legislation introduced by Congresswoman Terri A.
