I’m proud of the leadership the United States provides in the fight against AIDS. The @CDCgov and programs like @PEPFAR have been extremely effective in fighting the #HIV epidemic. I’m glad the Senate passed legislation this week to extend PEPFAR. #WAD2018 https://twitter.com/CDCGlobal/status/1068195560409186305 …,1068924635901771776,2018-12-01,17:47:47,senatorisakson,3,7,11
