"Natural gas in well water was not uncommon pre-fracking. Also, well diggers have died from exposure to gas in hand dug wells.  Ponds release the gas constantly from anaerobic digestion. Termites turn wood to natural gas. Millions of buffalo did too... before man killed them.",1092215894888071168,2019-02-04,00:18:56,repthomasmassie,5,31,206
Story reminds me the earth releases a lot of natural gas into the atmosphere. Folks who drilled my geothermal well said they hit gas once and had to abandon site for 2 days. Local guy told me there‚Äôs a place where they used to singe hogs by lighting gas coming from the ground. https://twitter.com/ZonePhysics/status/1092196048355897344¬†‚Ä¶,1092214049864118272,2019-02-04,00:11:36,repthomasmassie,17,39,233
