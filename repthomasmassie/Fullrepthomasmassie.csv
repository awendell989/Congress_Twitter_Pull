So my youngest daughter just binge watched “stranger things” and made this graphic on her iPhone.  Should I ground her or commend her for being a #sassywithmassie chip off the old block? pic.twitter.com/4eMqFi9tGR,1157477925127622656,2019-08-03,02:26:56,repthomasmassie,204,198,2466,2019-08-03 02:26:56

Agree. But the irony with this is that Elon Musk seems to be an AI /robot alarmist himself.,1157291737762713601,2019-08-02,14:07:06,repthomasmassie,2,0,2,2019-08-02 14:07:06
I like how you think.  The answer to most questions is found in the first 6 chapters of a Thermodynamics book.,1157289368765247488,2019-08-02,13:57:41,repthomasmassie,1,1,6,2019-08-02 13:57:41
There’s more forested land in Kentucky than there was 50 years ago even with land clearing for subdivision and factory development. Much farmland has gone back to nature due to efficiencies in production per acre. We’re going to be just fine. We haven’t even begun terraforming!,1157288981312266240,2019-08-02,13:56:09,repthomasmassie,1,0,18,2019-08-02 13:56:09

I agree. The idea that automation is bad for humankind is probably more widespread and more fantastical than flat-earth or scarce-earth theories. https://twitter.com/lukeambrosetti/status/1157283087451131904 …,1157284835603492864,2019-08-02,13:39:40,repthomasmassie,34,41,247,2019-08-02 13:39:40
"So you’re here to argue that our energy usage (per person) isn’t sustainable, or that everyone must live in a city for the betterment of mankind?  I’ll grant you those are different, yet related fallacies.",1157283895144058880,2019-08-02,13:35:56,repthomasmassie,2,0,19,2019-08-02 13:35:56
"What’s a theory that’s more widely believed and more fantastical than the flat earth theory?

The idea that land is scarce & humankind will run out of room in the next millennium.

At least the latter is disproven by a plane ride from NY to LA. ✈️ 🌎

"1. Shootings keep occurring in places where civilians are banned from having guns, 2. almost any modern firearm can be used to inflict mass casualties and 3. armed citizens prevent many attacks from becoming mass public shootings.",1157036088340504577,2019-08-01,21:11:14,repthomasmassie,66,168,649,2019-08-01 21:11:14
Media bias has a huge impact on the gun control debate. The entire debate would be dramatically different if at least three points about mass public shootings ever got coverage... https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/1157028241644953601 …,1157036085379325955,2019-08-01,21:11:14,repthomasmassie,33,142,498,2019-08-01 21:11:14
