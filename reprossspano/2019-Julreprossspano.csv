"We had a Motion to Recommit that would have amended the minimum wage bill & exempted small businesses who retain fewer than 10 employees or whose annual gross income is less than $1,000,000 from these job destroying wage hikes. Only 14 Dems voted to protect small business.",1151911213418385408,2019-07-18,17:46:49,reprossspano,23,45,55
Last night we authorized appropriations for FY20 intel & related activities. Today we'll vote on some real bad legislation that wants to double the min wage and reverse most of the gains our economy has had the past 2 yrs.

My job is to ensure the nation's safety & prosperity. I voted No on H.Res.489 as the tweets distract from more critical issues. The Dems are playing politics & I don't support their efforts to take down @POTUS.

Repubs made a Motion to Recommit NDAA to give troops the resources to strengthen our nat'l defense. Includes 4% pay raise & reverses cuts to readiness & training pgms to reduce accident rates.

This week we'll be looking at the NDAA. What do we know about it? It's less than our mil leaders asked for while slowing readiness & modernization plans and rejects key deterrent initiatives that help ensure security.
