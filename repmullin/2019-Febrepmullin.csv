I’ve always said that the most important part of any negotiation is knowing when to walk away. I’m proud to see @POTUS hold his ground in meetings with Kim Jong Un and leave a deal on the table—if it isn’t the best possible deal for the American people. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-wasnt-prepared-to-lift-us-sanctions-on-north-korea-leading-to-abrupt-end-to-summit …,1101150504900419585,2019-02-28,16:01:53,repmullin,9,2,30

The president’s #SOTU address delivered a message of unity to the American people. He made a plea that GOPs & Dems choose greatness.
