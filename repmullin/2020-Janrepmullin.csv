Many of you know that my family is the center of my life and being a dad is the most important job I have. My son Jim suffered injuries while wrestling and we are taking him to a specialist.

Nancy Pelosi has been playing the same political game for months now with the partisan impeachment sham. I hope once the Senate acquits President Trump that we can move on as a country. #WeeklyWrapUp pic.twitter.com/69Dl0PhgDi,1217903704113852416,2020-01-16,20:17:25,repmullin,47,33,106

That’s because impeaching our duly elected president is their biggest “accomplishment.” https://twitter.com/housegop/status/1217583212995710976 …,1217583868309647360,2020-01-15,23:06:30,repmullin,171,107,325
"When Speaker Pelosi announced the House would vote on articles of impeachment, she said it was an urgent national security concern. If it was so urgent, why did she wait nearly a month to send the articles? This has been purely political since day 1 & today’s vote is no different",1217520318559981568,2020-01-15,18:53:59,repmullin,28,27,75
