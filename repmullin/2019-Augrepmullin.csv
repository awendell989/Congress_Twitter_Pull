Great talking with employees and touring Vulcan Materials in Mill Creek. Our infrastructure is crumbling and desperately needs to be updated. Investing in infrastructure also means supporting local businesses and jobs. It’s a win-win for our communities. pic.twitter.com/RkQwRM0NF9,1167482110766022656,2019-08-30,17:00:00,repmullin,13,1,20
