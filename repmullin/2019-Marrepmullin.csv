The release of the #MuellerReport showed no collusion between @POTUS and the Russian government. Americans should never allow this to happen to another president. The United States is better than this. #WeeklyWrapUp pic.twitter.com/kC6nk8wexp,1111377095790223360,2019-03-28,21:18:42,repmullin,1023,45,167

It is a shame that Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats chose this week to pass a watered-down anti-hate resolution that didn’t even directly condemn Rep. Ilhan Omar’s anti-Semitic comments.
