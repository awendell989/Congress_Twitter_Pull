"Pelosi Democrats are continuing to try to impeach @realDonaldTrump even though he hasn’t committed a crime.

Today I voted against a resolution to continue Speaker Pelosi’s Soviet-style impeachment inquiry. This is nothing more than a vote to continue the sham process the Democrats have run for the past 37 days.,1189975990149226496,2019-10-31,18:42:39,repmullin,125,259,745
"This only applies to Phase 2 of the inquiry at @JudiciaryGOP. Here are the facts:
❌All hearings, transcripts & depositions aren’t open to the public
❌President’s counsel can’t attend Intel Committee hearings, unlike Clinton & Nixon

You can't have your cake and eat it too. This vote says you support the sham process to impeach our president. It is very much a vote for impeachment. https://twitter.com/RepKendraHorn/status/1189882037437706240 …,1189912541507530752,2019-10-31,14:30:32,repmullin,181,337,742
"ICYMI: 2 weeks ago, I wrote my Mullin It Over column on how the impeachment charade hurts American families. The longer this witch hunt goes on, the longer the American people have to wait for solutions to problems they face every day.

Chairman Adam Schiff is conducting the impeachment investigation behind closed doors even though none of the information is classified.
