"Proud to be back at the @alzassociation NoVa Walk to End Alzheimer’s. I lost my grandmother to Alzheimer’s, so I understand the toll it takes.

"The IRS collects more per capita from DC than ANY other state. 200,000 residents are federal employees, and 10,000 are active duty military. Yet they don't have a vote in Congress.
