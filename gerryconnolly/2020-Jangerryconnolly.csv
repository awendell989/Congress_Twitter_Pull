"If you want to stand with the people of Iran, @realDonaldTrump, you could start by not banning them from our country. 

And not threatening to blow up their cultural sites. 

And not further destabilizing their region with your incoherent foreign policy.

Should I keep going? https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1216114135529902081 …",1216141142267396103,2020-01-11,23:33:37,gerryconnolly,12,46,177

"I just left the administration's briefing on the strike that killed Qasem Soleimani. They tried, unsuccessfully, to conjure up a rationale for the president's reckless decision. 

It was sophomoric and utterly unconvincing. I left the room more troubled than when I went in.",1214991751443832835,2020-01-08,19:26:21,gerryconnolly,520,8594,29835

He was a bad actor and masterminded the killings of many US soldiers in Iraq and Lebanon. But his killing will lead to a significant increase in terrorism and retaliatory attacks against Americans.,1213067758679863297,2020-01-03,12:01:06,gerryconnolly,7,10,28
