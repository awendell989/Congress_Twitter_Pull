Nancy Pelosi’s newest funding proposal doesn’t represent any serious attempt to secure our border or find a compromise. A $1.3 billion Democrat wish list that includes zero money for a border barrier is a non-starter and will not be a legitimate answer to this impasse.,1079801412140306432,2018-12-31,18:08:13,repmarkmeadows,7917,6406,19829
"Nancy Pelosi told President Trump on national TV the House didn’t have the votes for a border wall bill. We did. It passed easily.

The House passed it. The WH wants it. The Senate majority wants it. The one blocking an open government and a secure border: Chuck Schumer.",1078356487951564805,2018-12-27,18:26:36,repmarkmeadows,5354,17206,43116

Chuck Schumer continues to block government funding over just $5B for a border wall. Meanwhile the government has previously dealt out billions in improper payments. Perhaps we can reach an agreement to use those recouped payments toward a wall?,1076856333981413377,2018-12-23,15:05:31,repmarkmeadows,3909,10339,29241

1) Republicans paid for it -- (Republicans did not pay for it)

All you need to know about Dir. Comey's sanctimonious lecture to Americans today is the fact he takes no responsibility for the erosion of trust in the FBI and DOJ. The rampant process abuses and breaches of protocol occurred on his watch. He refuses to be transparent about it.,1074859680386740224,2018-12-18,02:51:32,repmarkmeadows,2608,11432,30938
A question that needs answering: Why did Director Comey authorize agents to break protocol and bypass White House counsel in interviewing General Michael Flynn? It seems part of a pattern: Director Comey didn’t follow protocol. He treated different people by different rules.,1074771679937748994,2018-12-17,21:01:51,repmarkmeadows,2041,10268,25339

This was tremendous. The Opportunity Zones policy embodies the exact kind of principles our government ought to support: encouraging the use of market forces and private investment to help build up economically disadvantaged areas.
