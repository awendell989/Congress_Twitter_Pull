"Democrats applaud Obama for secretly going around Congress and sending $1.8 billion to Iran, yet they threaten to sue POTUS for using executive action to protect American families. Blatant politics. 

They didn't negotiate during the shutdown and are hardly pretending to now.",1091085162878849032,2019-01-31,21:25:48,repmarkmeadows,1219,8395,16148
"Amazing. Hardly 24 hours in to conference talks and Speaker Pelosi announces ""no wall money"" in a bill. This is a total and open refusal to even negotiate on something fundamental to a secure border.

Democrats insisted for a month they were ready to negotiate on border security when government reopened. It’s been nearly a week and we have yet to see even one Dem compromise counteroffer to the multiple proposals from POTUS.

Democrats decry federal workers not getting paid in one breath and then cancel votes to leave town early in another. Ridiculous—the shutdown is 33 days old. Where is the sense of urgency?

Technology and personnel are important. But there are areas of the border where we don't have a physical barrier and need one.
