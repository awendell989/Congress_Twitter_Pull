"Schiff has been reciting this line for almost two years, conveniently omitting key info every time. Reason why is simple: when you look at all the facts, you find no real evidence supporting ""Russian collusion"" exists.

An important move from the President here on Title X and yet another promise kept. Forcing taxpayers to fund abortion providers is wrong and should’ve ended long ago. https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/1099019423363592193 …,1099059272405737472,2019-02-22,21:32:04,repmarkmeadows,1160,5815,19379
Stunning admission here. McCabe is basically acknowledging he + his team opened an investigation of @realDonaldTrump without real evidence. There was no secret intelligence or smoking gun. Just things he and his biased team thought were “suspicious.” Incredible abuse of power. https://twitter.com/KenDilanianNBC/status/1098331417153540096 …,1098386301395656705,2019-02-21,00:57:55,repmarkmeadows,2063,9112,19936

"3 truths you won’t find in Andy McCabe’s book:
