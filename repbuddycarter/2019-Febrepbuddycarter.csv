Legislation to preserve the history & legacy of @FtFredericaNPS for generations is headed to @POTUS’s desk to be signed into law. I've been working on this since my 1st term in office with @SenatorIsakson & thrilled we're close to crossing the finish line. https://bit.ly/2Tpxtrm ,1101231966765096962,2019-02-28,21:25:35,repbuddycarter,4,5,17
I presented a flag flown over the Capitol to a brave young constituent Ja’Cori and his family. Ja’Cori fights a rare disease and is in D.C. to bring awareness to rare diseases. It was an honor to meet him. pic.twitter.com/wzpMCU4zKx,1100894045474304001,2019-02-27,23:02:48,repbuddycarter,3,5,23
What happened on the Senate floor tonight is down right revolting. DC Democrats refused to extend basic protections to babies born alive during botched abortions. I was on hand to see it happen & still cannot believe the callousness I saw firsthand. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-to-vote-on-born-alive-bill-to-protect-infants-who-survive-a-failed-abortion …,1100209637046079490,2019-02-26,01:43:13,repbuddycarter,16,8,14
The most immediate and significant impact we can have on prescription-drug pricing is to have transparency and expose the middleman. The gag clause prohibition signed into law last Congress was a good step in the right direction. Much more work to be done! https://on.wsj.com/2IxFAhd ,1100158975943815169,2019-02-25,22:21:54,repbuddycarter,8,33,72
