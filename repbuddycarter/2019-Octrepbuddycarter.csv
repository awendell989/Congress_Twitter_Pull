We have all seen the transcript. We have all seen the whistleblower report. There is nothing there. The American people deserve better, but Washington Dems continue their mission to overturn the election.",1189984778650607617,2019-10-31,19:17:34,repbuddycarter,78,67,292
"House Dem's impeachment resolution gives more power to Schiff & limits member involvement even more. 

It also continues to waste the American people's time.

Killing the evil leader of ISIS is a victory for the United States and all those around the world who stand with us against the scourge that is radical terrorism.
