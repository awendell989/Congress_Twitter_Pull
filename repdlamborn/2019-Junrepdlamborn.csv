House Democrats are STILL refusing to work in a bipartisan manner to address the worsening humanitarian crisis at the border. The Senate bill passed with 84 votes and could be signed into law by @POTUS TODAY. I call upon @SpeakerPelosi to bring this legislation to the floor NOW.,1144292873015300097,2019-06-27,17:14:15,repdlamborn,30,13,24

There is an ongoing crisis at the border and Democrats continue to play partisan games.
