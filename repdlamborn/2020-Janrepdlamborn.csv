"Speaker Pelosi tries to act like impeachment is a solemn occasion, but her grin gives it all away.

"The burning question today for the Senate impeachment trial is whether there will be witnesses.

"Pelosi just pulled a Schiff. On the House Floor, she blatantly misquoted the call between @POTUS & Zelensky. @realDonaldTrump never said, ""do me a favor."" Instead, he said do ""us"" (the United States) a favor. Pelosi should correct her remarks and stop spreading fake information.",1217514212219592705,2020-01-15,18:29:43,repdlamborn,150,940,1867

Speaker Pelosi's solo quest to impose her will on the Senate against bipartisan opposition has failed. It is time to end this charade and send the articles of #shampeachment to the Senate. https://twitter.com/senatemajldr/status/1216847278520045568 …,1216860070706892800,2020-01-13,23:10:23,repdlamborn,33,31,85

Speaker Pelosi has finally sent the #shampeachment articles to the Senate. She is ashamed of her shoddy process in the House and attempted to strongarm the Senate by never transmitting the articles. Her attempt failed & I look forward to the full exoneration of @realDonaldTrump,1215708139200352257,2020-01-10,18:53:01,repdlamborn,84,113,536

This disgraceful resolution does nothing but give comfort to Iran’s regime.
