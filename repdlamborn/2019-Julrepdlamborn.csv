"For over 2 years @POTUS has led historic reforms including tax cuts, rebuilding our military, and appointing constitutionalist judges.  In about the same time-frame, Bob Mueller only succeeded in dividing the country and wasting tax money.  #Mueller",1154144469907845125,2019-07-24,21:40:59,repdlamborn,93,40,174
"What a shocker! Dems say they will continue to investigate regardless of the failure of the Mueller report to find any crimes committed by @POTUS.

More wasted time & money. Why should we focus on problems like immigration when we can continue a senseless witch hunt? #Mueller",1154064108125401088,2019-07-24,16:21:39,repdlamborn,41,3,23
Did I miss something? Is there an exception in the law that says @POTUS is the only person who should not receive the same presumption of innocence as every American? This is absurd and sets an extremely dangerous precedent. #Mueller,1154056942530322432,2019-07-24,15:53:11,repdlamborn,48,25,107
"Mueller opening statement: ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian Government"".

Mueller appears to have allowed his Anti Trump staff to control this report. But even still, it doesn't change the facts. NO COLLUSION.",1154033791272226817,2019-07-24,14:21:11,repdlamborn,19,5,18
