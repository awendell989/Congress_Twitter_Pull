"Dems celebrated the end of ""phase two"" of their sham impeachment with drinks at a local bar and a cake in the SCIF.

"Just this week, Speaker Pelosi confirmed, ""We do not have time to pass USMCA.""

This has never been about the facts of the call. This is about the DC Swamp having issues with a President who wanted to shake things up and change foreign policy. Democrats simply refuse to accept @realdonaldTrump is our president. #ImpeachmentHoax,1197605175931932673,2019-11-21,19:58:19,repdlamborn,121,272,902

There is a lot of clowning around in the Intel cmte today. Looks like ringleader Schiff is back at it again with his circus show. He continually exploits the rules and probably wishes this show could go back down to the dungeon because these public hearings are failing.,1196943519933448192,2019-11-20,00:09:07,repdlamborn,62,30,107

This continuing resolution is an example of ineffective federal gov. Failing to provide stable funding hinders our warfighters & erodes our military readiness.

The cost of not passing a defense bill is watching Russia and China erode our military advantage. I urge House Dems to do their job & join bipartisan legislation to fund the gov & our military.
