The @usdol is implementing a $700 million cut to Job Corp Programs that provides skills training to thousands of students. A pilot program that serves 1600 students is not enough to replace the opportunity and education lost with the closing of Job Corp Programs. @EdLaborCmte,1123698510736572419,2019-05-01,21:19:36,repjahanahayes,2,9,28

I am embarrassed that 65 yrs after the #BrownvBoard  decision @edlaborcmte has to have a hearing on this. We must do everything in our power to finish the work of equity on our schools. Is this the education you would want for your child? pic.twitter.com/D3De1xWMqu,1123549889454116864,2019-05-01,11:29:02,repjahanahayes,8,36,161

Joined @RepBonnie & other @OfficialCBC members for the launch of the CBC Emergency Taskforce on Black Youth Suicide & Mental Health. Suicide rates are roughly double for black children under the age of 13 compared w/white children. We must stop this epidemic. pic.twitter.com/9HXWknmnaS,1123392597198876672,2019-05-01,01:04:01,repjahanahayes,1,7,13
