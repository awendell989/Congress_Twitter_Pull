I am deeply concerned by @realDonaldTrump’s announcement today that he intends to withdraw the U.S. from the INF Treaty unilaterally.  I am also concerned that the President once again is proceeding without coordination with our European allies. http://bit.ly/2Wy1eVG ,1091461134471884803,2019-02-01,22:19:47,leaderhoyer,11,18,47
"Appreciate @HouseAgDems bringing attention to @USDA’s harmful proposal that would cut nutrition assistance for vulnerable Americans. #NutritionAssistance keeps 40 million Americans from going hungry, and this proposal has already been rejected by Congress. https://twitter.com/HouseAgDems/status/1091398388455743488 …",1091458030250721281,2019-02-01,22:07:27,leaderhoyer,1,8,15

"Today’s #JobsReport has to be viewed in the context that 800,000 Americans workers effectively had their jobs taken away & were denied 2 paychecks, forcing them to go to food banks or to take out risky payday loans as a result of the #TrumpShutdown. http://bit.ly/2BdBLbg ",1091397580968415232,2019-02-01,18:07:15,leaderhoyer,14,8,21
I share @RepAdamSmith’s deep concern that @DeptofDefense appeared before Congress for a hearing on active duty personnel at the southern border this week & failed to disclose the planned increase in troops. Misleading Congress & hiding information is unacceptable. https://twitter.com/RepAdamSmith/status/1091182638445092865 …,1091344644431118336,2019-02-01,14:36:54,leaderhoyer,10,21,39
