"President Zelensky did not know that aid was under review when the call occurred. The aid was released without beginning an investigation. That’s not a quid pro quo, or bribery, or whatever House Democrats want to call it. 

It’s time for this sham impeachment to end. (2/2)",1197994055914926080,2019-11-22,21:43:35,drphilroe,19,4,23
"After two weeks of hearings, these key facts remain true. @realDonaldTrump and President Zelensky agree there was no pressure to initiate investigations. The transcripts of their calls show no pressure. (1/2)",1197994055193509889,2019-11-22,21:43:35,drphilroe,16,8,25

We need to learn the whistleblower's sources and who the information was shared with.

"With Democrats’ public impeachment hearings starting tomorrow, it’s worth noting: holding public hearings in which witnesses are handpicked to help the Democrats’ narrative is not fair or transparent.
