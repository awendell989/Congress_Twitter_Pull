I am embarrassed to be on the committee today because of the majority’s shameful tactics. We need to restore the bipartisan regular order process we’ve had on the committee in the past for the sake of our veterans. (2/2),1189302696366559235,2019-10-29,22:07:13,drphilroe,49,53,158
"In my 10+ years on HVAC, I've never seen this committee be conducted in such a partisan fashion.

"@realDonaldTrump is trying to address China’s unfair trade practices & strengthen America’s hand in negotiations through the USMCA. So why aren’t we taking it up?
