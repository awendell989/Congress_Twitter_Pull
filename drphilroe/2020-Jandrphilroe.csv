Speaker Pelosi’s decision to delay sending the articles of impeachment against @realDonaldTrump to the Senate shows how unserious this effort is. I’m glad she is sending them next week because Americans are ready for the sham impeachment to be over with!,1215718746792300544,2020-01-10,19:35:10,drphilroe,14,9,44

"There's no question Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani was a bad actor and a danger to the U.S. as well as our allies. His plots threatened countless American lives.
