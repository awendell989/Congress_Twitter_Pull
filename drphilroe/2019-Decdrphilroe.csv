Today is a sad day in American history. We are voting to impeach a duly-elected @realDonaldTrump  without evidence a crime was committed. I won’t stand for this political sham and will be voting no. pic.twitter.com/snEEMtl0Ve,1207429251730956288,2019-12-18,22:35:41,drphilroe,1391,5827,19472

Impeaching @realDonaldTrump with no evidence is dangerous & will create a new normal that impeachment is acceptable because two branches of government disagree. I hope my Democrat colleagues will consider the consequences of impeaching a duly-elected president based on politics. pic.twitter.com/Q7c4dTOWIF,1207308010537803776,2019-12-18,14:33:55,drphilroe,185,291,749
Great to have @bvandahlen with PREVENTS Task Force in Johnson City to hear about the work being done to prevent suicide in East Tennessee.
