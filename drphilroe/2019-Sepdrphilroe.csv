"All sides agree we need to protect patients, and I am very committed to getting a bill across the finish line. @realdonaldrump is right: this is a great opportunity end surprise medical bills for patients once and for all. (4/4)",1177681055047913473,2019-09-27,20:26:58,drphilroe,5,3,3
"For example, @SenBillCassidy’s legislation uses an arbitration-based model with different factors that CBO confirms saves money. But restricting physicians’ ability to negotiate with a fixed rate will have negative consequences for patient access to care. (3/4)",1177681054414622722,2019-09-27,20:26:58,drphilroe,1,0,3
"Allowing a free-market, private-sector negotiation between two private entities on how much a service should cost isn’t a bad thing. If the debate is about the factors on which arbiters can base their decision in our bill, I think that’s perfectly reasonable. (2/4)",1177681053747761153,2019-09-27,20:26:58,drphilroe,2,1,2
"@avik, I appreciate your good work on free market health care reform, but respectfully disagree here. I understand why private equity firms are the bogeymen in this debate, but hardworking doctors will be collateral damage under a benchmark rate.

"This morning, I joined @TheTakeaway to discuss why I believe it was the wrong decision to launch an impeachment inquiry into @POTUS.

"Yesterday, committee Democrats voted against my amendment that guaranteed workers the right to a secret ballot in union elections.

"Democratic leadership wants the public to believe they are reluctant to begin an impeachment inquiry, but the truth is this is 100 percent calculated and political. (3/3)",1176970943043948544,2019-09-25,21:25:14,drphilroe,6,3,11
"The other half supported impeaching the President before producing any evidence of wrongdoing. Ever since President Trump set foot in office, Democrats could not accept their loss and have been foaming at the mouth to undermine his presidency.

I could not be more strongly against what Speaker Pelosi is doing to undermine President Trump with her move to begin impeachment proceedings. Half of the Democratic caucus believed impeachment was warranted after Robert Mueller declared he found no evidence of collusion. (1/3),1176970941060079616,2019-09-25,21:25:14,drphilroe,20,4,20
