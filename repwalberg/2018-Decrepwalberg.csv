Bush, none is so special as the picture of the President’s casket draped with the flag of the nation he humbly served and loved. It says it all.

I'll never forget the first time our entire family met President Bush in Michigan. He was as warm and friendly as could be. He asked about our kids and even took time to offer my daughter an autograph. He had a special persona that was all about others. pic.twitter.com/d6mm8KHmJo,1068926213450854400,2018-12-01,17:54:03,repwalberg,2,1,8
