".@SecretarySonny is absolutely correct - China has built their economy largely by taking advantage of and stealing from our Ag-producers and many others for a long time. Bilateral trade deals & deals like #USMCA will ensure America wins again, not China. https://twitter.com/SecretarySonny/status/1167075582120747008 …",1167447388908400640,2019-08-30,14:42:02,reprickcrawford,11,2,9
"#FentanylChina continues funneling drugs in to America. Authorities seized 66-pounds in VA this week, enough to kill over 10 million people. In Mexico, they seized over 50k pounds of the fatal substance.

Happy to see that Jonesboro was chosen as the location for Delta Peanut's new shelling location.

A new #trade agreement with #Japan is good news as they are a top ten market for our #soybean producers. It will also help them as more #pork and #beef are exported to Japan as a value-added component. More bi-lateral deals are good for our producers!,1166044178121469952,2019-08-26,17:46:10,reprickcrawford,9,4,22
