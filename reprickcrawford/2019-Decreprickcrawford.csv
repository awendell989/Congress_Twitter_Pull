Maybe they all see what most Americans see and that’s no impeachable offense! #shampeachment #SchiffShow https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1201965626643951617 …",1201981185393643522,2019-12-03,21:47:00,reprickcrawford,18,6,18
"Maybe a moment of honest reflection by Schiff as he realizes his own #Shampeachment hasn’t resulted in what the Speaker said this needed to be (bipartisan), and that the American people aren’t buying what House Democrats are trying to sell them. https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1201967305376223232 …",1201971804358795265,2019-12-03,21:09:44,reprickcrawford,21,7,17
👇🏼 below is what we *could* have been working on the last several months instead of the #shampeachment https://twitter.com/RepSamGraves/status/1201959223594225666 …,1201962656153907201,2019-12-03,20:33:23,reprickcrawford,61,70,201
The truth is nothing the President did rises to impeachment. He discussed a visit to the WH in April with the Ukraine President. Pres Zelensky has said he wasn’t pressured & no quid-pro-quo. This started hours in to Pres Trumps presidency. It’s been a #shampeachment from day one!,1201946879979925504,2019-12-03,19:30:41,reprickcrawford,9,7,15
"The President through the Constitution sets the foreign policy of the United States. In Schiff’s #shampeachment, only one witness talked to the President. He was told “no quid pro quo” & “tell the truth” to Congress. At least three different “charges”, this is “abuse of power”?",1201946869011800065,2019-12-03,19:30:39,reprickcrawford,14,13,24
"There was a time House Democrats said they could walk and chew gum (impeachment and legislating) at the same time. There are two, perhaps three, weeks left to vote. Let’s vote on #USMCA! https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1201545726188240901 …",1201557495975690240,2019-12-02,17:43:25,reprickcrawford,17,8,40
