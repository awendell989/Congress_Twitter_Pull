I was honored to host @SecretarySonny yesterday as he stopped in AR & spent time with a multitude of folks involved in production Ag. @realDonaldTrump has a strong leader at #USDA & I stand ready to assist as we keep fighting China for our Ag-producers! https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/sep/05/perdue-visits-offers-assurances-2019090/¬†‚Ä¶,1169613984099643394,2019-09-05,14:11:18,reprickcrawford,7,12,48
