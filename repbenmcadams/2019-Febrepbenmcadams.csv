"That‚Äôs my point. Both sides reached a bipartisan deal. Neither side loved it. That‚Äôs compromise. If the President, R or D, can do whatever they want when Congress doesn‚Äôt agree with them, then that is a dangerous precedent and undermines our constitutional balance of powers.",1099072823727775744,2019-02-22,22:25:55,repbenmcadams,2,1,31
I support the resolution to block the President from spending almost $8 billion w/out approval from Congress. Our Constitution separates powers to ensure a democratic process.
