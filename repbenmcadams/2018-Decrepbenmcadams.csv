#SLCo Council votes to pass the 2019 Salt Lake County budget. We worked in a bipartisan fashion to propose and pass a fiscally responsible budget that responds to the needs of county residents. #utpol #2019budget pic.twitter.com/lrnwhJvPw3,1070125707555090432,2018-12-05,01:20:25,repbenmcadams,0,1,12
Submitted my resignation letter to the County Council today. Jan. 2nd is my last day as county mayor - this is a job I've loved. Happy that the next mayor will oversee a balanced budget w/no tax increase. #slco #utpol,1069681967862403072,2018-12-03,19:57:09,repbenmcadams,10,9,138
