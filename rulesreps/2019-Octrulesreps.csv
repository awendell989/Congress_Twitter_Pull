FLOOR ALERT: @HouseDemocrats just BLOCKED @TomColeOK04's request to pass 3 simple TRANSPARENCY provisions allowing the American people to know what Dems are hiding behind closed doors.

Question for @RulesDemocrats: why bring forward a process resolution if you refuse to have a meaningful discussion on process - but rather fixate on your hatred for the president?,1189711842693853184,2019-10-31,01:13:01,rulesreps,3,20,45
".@RulesDemocrats dismissed every single idea and called legitimate questions on Pelosi’s process resolution “sideshows” and that the details were “not a big deal.” Apparently, H.

Democrats shouldn’t get to cherry pick what evidence gets considered. @RepDLesko’s 3 amendments would have preserved transparency for the American people. Guess what @RulesDemocrats thought?,1189684435022745607,2019-10-30,23:24:07,rulesreps,40,98,245
