"I know that the @Titans will crush the @Chiefs this Sunday!

States like Tennessee that refuse to expand Medicaid are keeping hundreds of thousands of their own people from getting coverage and repealing this landmark health care law would threaten health care insurance for millions of Americans.,1218243951523770369,2020-01-17,18:49:26,repjimcooper,1,3,23
The Commonwealth Fund report released today confirms what we’ve known for years: Medicaid expansion under the ACA helped insure millions more people. The significant increases in coverage among African Americans exemplifies this. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2020/01/16/the-health-202-obamacare-improved-but-didn-t-fix-the-uninsured-gap-between-black-and-white-americans/5e1f473b88e0fa2262dcdef0/ …,1218243950588416001,2020-01-17,18:49:26,repjimcooper,6,12,35

"This is discrimination plain and simple. TN has thousands of children in foster care, many eligible for adoption. We should not deny LGBTQ couples the opportunity to be caring parents.

One of the gravest dangers of this radical waiver request is reducing the little transparency we have into the workings of TennCare. @CMSGov should reject this dangerous plan.

This War Powers Resolution is necessary to prevent the president’s further disregard of Congress’ constitutional role and limits the president’s military actions in Iran without Congress’ express authorization. https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/83/text …,1215391874829234177,2020-01-09,21:56:18,repjimcooper,16,13,46

"But the president’s misguided actions have sped up those capabilities, made America less safe, and left us with less influence in the most dangerous region at a critical time. America’s leadership is needed more than ever, but never before has our leadership been so questioned.",1215016917594976260,2020-01-08,21:06:21,repjimcooper,6,1,17
