This bill will allow the voices of more Americans to be heard. https://twitter.com/RepMcGovern/status/1155492491468181505 …,1155863751343661057,2019-07-29,15:32:47,repjimcooper,6,18,69
Everyone has a right to due process under the law. Expedited removal encourages racial profiling and denies immigrants their right to go before a judge. It does not make our country safer.
