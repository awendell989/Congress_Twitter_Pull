No one should ever fear dropping off their children at school. That's why today I was glad to vote for bipartisan legislation to ensure universal background checks for gun sales. We must take this commonsense step to keep our communities safe. https://cnn.it/2SsEjb3 ,1100929178101198848,2019-02-28,01:22:24,repbera,4,4,18

I voted to reject the President’s unnecessary emergency declaration. Our Constitution has a clear separation of powers – Congress decides how to appropriate taxpayer money. Both parties should support border security and our Constitution. https://bit.ly/2EzDVEc ,1100599636463681542,2019-02-27,03:32:56,repbera,8,3,28
President Trump’s plan to gut Planned Parenthood funding is outrageous. A woman’s health care decisions must remain between her and her doctor. Washington politicians have no place in the exam room. https://politi.co/2GXTTt3 ,1099052271889981444,2019-02-22,21:04:15,repbera,313,366,859
