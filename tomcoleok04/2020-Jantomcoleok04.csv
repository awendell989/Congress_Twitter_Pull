The war powers resolution by @HouseDemocrats says more about their opposition to @POTUS than exercising congressional authority. Article II of the Constitution clearly gives the president legal authority to use DEFENSIVE military force in response to imminent threats to the U.S. pic.twitter.com/iBK7uKCL7G,1215101567206141953,2020-01-09,02:42:43,tomcoleok04,46,49,156
