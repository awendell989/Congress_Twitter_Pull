I stand with the President in his commitment to secure our border. Congressional Democrats failed the American people by refusing to provide adequate funding for barriers and I support President Trump’s necessary actions to end the humanitarian crisis and secure our border.,1096528883376111627,2019-02-15,21:57:12,greschenthaler,7,13,42
