Had a great visit at the Ironworkers Local 3 Training Center. I’ve been working to protect our local apprenticeship programs that play a vital role in our area. Their slogan “We don’t go to the office. We build it.” reminds us why we support SWPA energy development & job creation pic.twitter.com/UdQmgMvLv5,1178752506274467843,2019-09-30,19:24:32,greschenthaler,10,6,24
Thank you to @GOPLeader and @senatemajldr for your leadership in supporting USMCA. House Democrats continue to block this win for American workers. They need to stop playing politics and bring this up for a vote. https://twitter.com/WSJopinion/status/1178407971006619650 …,1178668590536577024,2019-09-30,13:51:05,greschenthaler,50,90,196

Thank you @RepMcCaul and my @HouseForeignGop colleagues for your leadership. Speaker Pelosi's partisan games play right into the hands of Putin.
