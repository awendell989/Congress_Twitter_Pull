John Bolton has first hand knowledge of the underlying facts behind the first Article of Impeachment. This argument is bogus.,1214273742488121349,2020-01-06,19:53:14,brianschatz,45,294,2542
Nonsense. John Bolton has information relevant to the first Article of Impeachment. He has direct knowledge. What Marco is saying here is that the Senate should not conduct a fair trial at all - that we move directly from opening statements to closing arguments and a vote. https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1214269985004163073 …,1214272388826828803,2020-01-06,19:47:52,brianschatz,45,440,1756
