Republican members of Congress voted to uphold Trump’s emergency declaration and now military construction projects are being raided in their home states to fund the wall. This was a true test of Trump loyalty - to raid military funding from your own home state is quite a choice.,1169357195089104896,2019-09-04,21:10:55,brianschatz,53,1336,4512,2019-09-04 21:10:55
