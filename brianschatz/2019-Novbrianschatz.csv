Doug Jones prosecuted the racist Birmingham bomber and is a great Senator. His opponent will be either Jeff Sessions or Roy Moore and if that doesn’t make you want to send money I don’t know what to tell you. But seriously please give.

The reason that the President is alleging that the public transcripts are fraudulent is that he doesn’t see a better argument than that. And the fact that he is lying about something so basic shows that he has no substantive defense for his behavior.  He did it. He said so.,1191157660097241091,2019-11-04,00:58:11,brianschatz,136,3272,15884

I think we are so used to the lies that we are underestimating how offensive it is to this constitutional process that  the President is defending himself primarily by lying about basic facts.,1190814396416610305,2019-11-03,02:14:11,brianschatz,51,804,4186
