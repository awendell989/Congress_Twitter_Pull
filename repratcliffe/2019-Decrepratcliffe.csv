"Acting as both judge and prosecutor, Democrats tell America they don’t need any more evidence or testimony before impeaching the President. So it’s fair to impeach him on that evidence and testimony—but it’s not enough  evidence and testimony for a Senate trial? Great strategy.",1206759558376542213,2019-12-17,02:14:33,repratcliffe,836,8084,22209

"The president took the unprecedented step of releasing a transcript so everyone could see the truth. 

Here’s another transcript everyone should see: sworn testimony confirming that the whistleblower didn’t tell the truth both verbally and in writing. But Schiff won’t release it. pic.twitter.com/uRCvDPK1rg",1205179494748827648,2019-12-12,17:35:57,repratcliffe,4496,20289,50231
"Alexander Hamilton said the greatest danger of impeachment would be depriving a president of due process and using impeachment politically by the party that has the most votes in the House.

"The IG’s role is to find facts, not to necessarily make conclusions. The facts in Horowitz’s report say that the FBI’s senior leadership kept an investigation going based on an entirely unreliable dossier even though they knew they didn’t have a valid basis to do so. pic.twitter.com/cTdLi6VaGS",1204198159926386689,2019-12-10,00:36:28,repratcliffe,153,2180,4385
Democrats want to impeach Trump without allowing a single question to be asked of a single witness about why IG Atkinson wasn’t told the truth about contacts between the whistleblower and Schiff.

Speaker Pelosi announces that Democrats will move forward with articles of impeachment just days before the IG is set to release his findings regarding allegations of surveillance abuses against the Trump campaign.
