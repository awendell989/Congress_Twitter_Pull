"After the transcript showed nothing improper, President Zelensky said publicly there was nothing improper. Now Democrats want an investigation because a whistleblower with no first-hand knowledge knows better than Zelensky does about what he really meant to say.

"The whistleblower was wrong to assert that the President’s actions constituted ""a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or Executive Order.” 

I guess that’s what happens when you base a whistleblower complaint off secondhand information and media reports. pic.twitter.com/C6z8Xx3eKE",1177294975031271425,2019-09-26,18:52:49,repratcliffe,975,5415,13555
The Democrats continue to make false accusations about crimes that didn’t occur and promise evidence that doesn’t exist – and they can never deliver – this time at the expense of our national security. pic.twitter.com/vHnhGQPVhC,1176907649469833217,2019-09-25,17:13:44,repratcliffe,631,832,1947

Chairman Nadler's current argument on impeachment is entirely inconsistent with what he was saying back in 1998 with respect to the Clinton impeachment hearing. He wants to change the rules because the rules need to be changed to get Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/dPXBQxNVSy,1172186608797442048,2019-09-12,16:34:00,repratcliffe,96,610,1195
