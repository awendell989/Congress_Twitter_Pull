I am deeply grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to lead our Nation’s intelligence community and work on behalf of all the public servants who are tirelessly devoted to defending the security and safety of the United States.,1155673416231510017,2019-07-29,02:56:28,repratcliffe,4678,9784,40220

I'm grateful President Trump signed @ChuckGrassley's Senate version of my bill to effectively punish the possession of biological toxins. This new law will help keep dangerous substances out of the hands of people who can use them for malign activity. https://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1154526330676842497 …,1154760859417288704,2019-07-26,14:30:17,repratcliffe,52,336,962
"Sometimes the book is better than the movie. Democrats paid a heavy price for dragging a reluctant Robert Mueller, who was not familiar with the terms of his own report, to center stage. This was on display very clearly and, at times, very painfully before the American people. pic.twitter.com/1Anya9yQS9",1154399746628489218,2019-07-25,14:35:21,repratcliffe,1074,2518,6686

Today’s hearings with Mueller completely sunk any argument for impeachment. You can't impeach a president on obstruction charges when the special counsel admits he applied a legal standard that’s never been applied to anyone in the history of American jurisprudence. pic.twitter.com/c7xu2ZquIG,1154162915018256384,2019-07-24,22:54:16,repratcliffe,631,4136,10013

It wasn’t the special counsel’s job to conclusively determine Donald Trump’s innocence or exonerate him because the bedrock principle of our justice system is a presumption of innocence. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGWypfZbYz0 …,1154042049332535300,2019-07-24,14:54:00,repratcliffe,668,2977,9468
I commend the Trump administration's new efforts to help ensure families move toward self-sufficiency after receiving minimal TANF benefits by closing a loophole that has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines for SNAP. https://twitter.com/USDANutrition/status/1153661067110883329 …,1153672499701387264,2019-07-23,14:25:32,repratcliffe,307,153,499

I commend the Trump administration for standing up against Turkey’s decision to purchase Russian S-400 air defense systems. Actions that undermine the NATO Allies’ commitment to move away from Russian systems cannot be taken lightly. https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-64 …,1151594508892745731,2019-07-17,20:48:21,repratcliffe,34,117,337
