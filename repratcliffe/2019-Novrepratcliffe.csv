I know why @paulsperry_ It’s because I asked IG Atkinson about his “investigation” into the contacts between Schiff’s staff and the person who later became the whistleblower. The transcript is classified “secret” so Schiff can prevent you from seeing the answers to my questions,1200799511381233664,2019-11-30,15:31:27,repratcliffe,674,6639,12057
"Yeah, it’s what happens when Dems start polling which impeachable offense to frame the President for doing 6 weeks AFTER they started impeaching him. https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/1196838686593183744 …",1198611352719372289,2019-11-24,14:36:30,repratcliffe,268,1648,4518

Sondland admits Trump told him “I want no quid pro quo.” Also admits his opinion that there was quid pro quo is based on a “presumption” – and is directly contradicted by Volker and Morrison. Reasonable people having different conclusions isn’t compelling evidence to impeach. pic.twitter.com/aYaxH7O2xc,1197254280731906050,2019-11-20,20:43:59,repratcliffe,1045,7637,19789
"In the 3,500 pages of transcripts released so far, there was only one reference to bribery. Ironically to describe Vice President Biden’s conduct, not President Trump’s. 
 
Why did we go from quid pro quo to extortion now to bribery? The answer is polling. pic.twitter.com/2ypnc6HyDT",1196847658402566144,2019-11-19,17:48:12,repratcliffe,3206,14913,39430

"Listen to the liberal media and House Dems change their story after Taylor’s testimony is clear that nobody in the Ukrainian government was aware of a military hold at the time of the Trump-Zelensky call.

It’s more than just bias—it’s an actual legal conflict of interest. Schiff is using his authority as a Chairman presiding over an impeachment inquiry to prevent the investigation and discovery of facts about his own actions or the actions of his staff. https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/01/rep-john-ratcliffe-adam-schiffs-problem-isnt-that-hes-biased-its-that-hes-running-a-corrupt-process/ …,1190295800104062976,2019-11-01,15:53:28,repratcliffe,388,4920,8612
