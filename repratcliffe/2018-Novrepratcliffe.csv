The U.S. will no longer turn a blind eye toward the UN’s blatant bias against Israel. I appreciate @nikkihaley’s strong leadership in support of our allies. https://twitter.com/USUN/status/1063197862299881472 …,1063467381371142144,2018-11-16,16:22:36,repratcliffe,8,34,99

I applaud the final passage of H.R. 3359 to redesignate and reorganize @NPPD as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. I look forward to the great work that will be accomplished through a more clearly defined structure at our nation’s lead cybersecurity agency.,1062513092914044928,2018-11-14,01:10:36,repratcliffe,5,20,72
