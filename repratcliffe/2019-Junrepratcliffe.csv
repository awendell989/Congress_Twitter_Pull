"I introduced the Separation of Powers Restoration Act because of my concern that unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats have too much power.

"It’s not enough to speak out against hacking our voting systems, but then do nothing to actively deter it. I just introduced new bipartisan legislation with @jahimes to punish election interference. pic.twitter.com/80JOHj16RS",1138876425421893633,2019-06-12,18:31:13,repratcliffe,28,100,244

There’s a 0% chance that Democratic lawyers are going to walk into court and argue that the U.S. AG should be held in contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena that requires him to commit a crime. H.Res. 430 was just another show vote to waste our time. pic.twitter.com/IFh7QX4ct9,1138801081666981888,2019-06-12,13:31:50,repratcliffe,336,1624,4561

Cooperating with Mexico to secure our borders is vital to Texas and U.S. interests.
