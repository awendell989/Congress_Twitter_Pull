"No one is above the law, not even the President. Today, we assert this truth, uphold our constitutional duty, and hold President Trump accountable for his actions.

This administration’s failed policies have led to chaos and the loss of human lives at our southern border. We should not be giving this president more $ for an immoral/ineffective wall OR allowing him to transfer funds to further carry out his heartless agenda.
