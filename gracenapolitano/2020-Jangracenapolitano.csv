What we saw today was shocking to say the least. The Trump administration should be ashamed of #RemainInMexico and the #TentCourts. We must hold them accountable for this travesty & fight for migrant families to be treated with dignity and respect. #DemsAtTheBorder #DontLookAway pic.twitter.com/BcuZvoP6EM,1218233088163053568,2020-01-17,18:06:16,gracenapolitano,10,41,64

Shameful and appalling that the Trump Administration is treating migrants and asylum seekers like this - #RemainInMexico is dangerous and the #TentCourts deny due process. We must hold @DHSgov and @CBP accountable for what we witness today. #DontLookAway #DemsAtTheBorder,1218180106117623808,2020-01-17,14:35:44,gracenapolitano,3,13,25
"Hearing the firsthand accounts of lawyers/advocates who have visited Matamoros MX tent camps, where 3k+ migrants wait in limbo & squalor.
