Supreme Court will hear challenge to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And it is about time... we need clarity whether CFPB can continue to operate outside of legal precedents.

I believe the decision to withdraw from Syria is the wrong decision. Today I voted with a strong bipartisan majority in support of the Kurds and against the withdrawal. https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1184542877977923586 …,1184576257687785473,2019-10-16,21:06:02,rephuizenga,24,8,34
Great news for #Muskegon County! It was just announced the #GLRI will play a leading role in cleaning up the area of concern next to Muskegon Lake.
