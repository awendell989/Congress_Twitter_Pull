It is extremely disappointing that Michigan’s Senators chose partisan politics today instead of protecting innocent infants who just survived an attempted abortion. Read my op-ed on why the Born Alive Survivors Protection Act should rise above partisanship  https://www.grandhaventribune.com/Column/2019/02/19/In-defense-of-born-alive-survivors …,1100183745687113729,2019-02-26,00:00:20,rephuizenga,29,17,49

John Dingell was a fierce advocate for Michigan and a titan of the House who worked with a servant’s heart. I will remember John as someone who always fought for the constitutional standing of the House. My heart and prayers go out to Debbie and the entire Dingell family.,1093701353510182912,2019-02-08,02:41:37,rephuizenga,2,5,36
Today we remember the brave @NASA astronauts who lost their lives leading our nation into the final frontier. We especially hold in our hearts #WestMichigan’s own Roger B. Chaffee who tragically died with the crew of Apollo 1 in 1967.  #DayOfRememberance pic.twitter.com/EBYZpXnEmZ,1093637838355267584,2019-02-07,22:29:14,rephuizenga,4,5,16

Thank you @GOPLeader for asking for unanimous consent to protect born-alive infants. I am a cosponsor of @RepAnnWagner's Born Alive Survivors Protection Act. This shouldn't be remotely partisan. Let's save lives together and promote a culture that defends and respects life!,1093212122299936768,2019-02-06,18:17:35,rephuizenga,33,42,302
