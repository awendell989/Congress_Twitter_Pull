The ESCAPE Act will free Europe and our NATO allies from Russian bullying by sanctioning #NordStream2 pipeline & providing them with reliable & dependable American energy. It’s time to shut off Putin’s pipeline valve by opening Europe’s escape valve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0NXA9xi46o&t=5s …,1141408238082174976,2019-06-19,18:11:44,senjohnbarrasso,5,6,14

The ESCAPE Act will eliminate this geopolitical weapon by sanctioning #NordStream2 & expanding U.S. natural gas exports. America has an abundance of natural gas which can be used to help our allies & loosen Putin’s economic & political grip on the region.  https://bit.ly/31og2bQ ,1139196043525074945,2019-06-13,15:41:16,senjohnbarrasso,27,18,59
@realDonaldTrump was right when he said that Germany will be held hostage by Russia if they move forward with Russia’s #NordStream2 gas pipeline.
