Nuclear energy is critical if we are going to reduce carbon emissions in a meaningful way. My draft legislation takes commonsense steps to advance the licensing of the Yucca Mountain facility & strengthens the nation’s nuclear waste management program. https://bit.ly/2W5BC1U ,1121070384785260545,2019-04-24,15:16:22,senjohnbarrasso,16,13,29

I applaud @realDonaldTrump taking action to stop states from hijacking the Clean Water Act. Washington state & east coast states have used this authority to slow down important energy projects. https://bit.ly/2I96MSw ,1116100549575835648,2019-04-10,22:08:01,senjohnbarrasso,15,11,45

The water quality certification process is being abused in order to delay important energy projects. Washington state has hijacked the water quality certification process & blocked #Wyoming coal from being exported.,1115722312958001153,2019-04-09,21:05:03,senjohnbarrasso,3,6,20
