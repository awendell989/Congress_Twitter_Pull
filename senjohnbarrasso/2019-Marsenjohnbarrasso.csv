Nicole Nason will do an excellent job leading @USDOTFHWA. She will be an important partner as Congress drafts and implements bipartisan highway infrastructure legislation. https://bit.ly/2JJklJV ,1111343639593209856,2019-03-28,19:05:46,senjohnbarrasso,20,5,18
Pat retires on Monday after 18 years of service to our state--he holds the title of Wyoming’s longest-serving state engineer. He’s done great work for Wyoming and water users throughout the West. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0z4RqwEVW4 …,1111026623179046912,2019-03-27,22:06:03,senjohnbarrasso,5,3,17
Thank you to Wyoming State Engineer Pat Tyrrell for testifying today in the Senate on how important it is that Congress passes a Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O1OKb7sJ2k … pic.twitter.com/wh3YkM74pe,1111025505174781959,2019-03-27,22:01:36,senjohnbarrasso,7,6,24
Why did Senate Democrats just duck a vote on your #GreenNewDeal? #DemsDuck #VotedPresent https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1110544562857091073 …,1110664676206133252,2019-03-26,22:07:48,senjohnbarrasso,1548,682,2561
"The #GreenNewDeal is not the solution for America. It’s a big green bomb that will blow a hole in our strong, healthy & growing economy. That’s exactly why Dems aren’t voting for it & it’s exactly why Dems are running away from it as fast as they can. https://bit.ly/2FBxOiV ",1110654974516703232,2019-03-26,21:29:15,senjohnbarrasso,51,26,63

"The Green New Deal “makes promises that are not achievable or realistic.”  

Proud that @SenateGOP shares the same goal of investing in new technologies like carbon capture that will make a difference in reducing CO2. pic.twitter.com/fWswagoblc",1105236373202763782,2019-03-11,22:37:40,senjohnbarrasso,49,70,172
"The @AFLCIO, which represents 12.5 million workers & includes 55 labor unions, slams the #GreenNewDeal in a letter to @SenMarkey & @AOC:

“We will not accept proposals that could cause immediate harm to millions of our members and their families.” 

I agree with the AFL-CIO. pic.twitter.com/pEVhr9Ricr",1105236370681982977,2019-03-11,22:37:39,senjohnbarrasso,238,367,712

Not only was it home to the first female governor and the first woman to be appointed justice of the peace, it also approved the first state constitution that granted women the right to vote. #InternationalWomensDay pic.twitter.com/GHX4PvEvjB",1104106233630470144,2019-03-08,19:46:54,senjohnbarrasso,46,30,112
