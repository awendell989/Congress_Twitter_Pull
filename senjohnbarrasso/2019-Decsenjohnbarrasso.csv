"Democrats have been obsessed with impeaching @realDonaldTrump since day one. Tonight, they cast one of the most divisive votes in American history.

Obamacare has failed to live up to its promises. This ruling highlights the need to modernize and personalize health care for every American.

The Fifth Circuit finally ruled what we all knew: #Obamacare’s individual mandate is unconstitutional. Now it will be up to the district court to find what parts of the law can survive.  http://bit.ly/2M8Ql9j ,1207432569886777344,2019-12-18,22:48:52,senjohnbarrasso,23,73,207

NDAA also imposes sanctions on those involved in installing Russia’s #NordStream2 pipeline. President Putin uses Russia’s natural gas to extort & threaten our allies. These sanctions will help stop this pipeline & eliminate Russia’s geopolitical weapon.  https://bit.ly/34sBa0P ,1207010001014992901,2019-12-17,18:49:44,senjohnbarrasso,10,6,21

Spoke on the Senate floor today in honor of the 150th anniversary of WY women’s suffrage.
