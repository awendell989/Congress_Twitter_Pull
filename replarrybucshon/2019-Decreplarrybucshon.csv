Speaker Pelosi is now holding the articles of impeachment and not sending them to the Senate. What are the Dems afraid of? I thought President Trump was an imminent threat to the Constitution and our Democracy? Politics plain and simple. Give me a break!

House Democrats have been obsessed with impeaching President Trump since he was elected in 2016. Their blatant refusal to accept the will of the American people in that election undermines our democracy and effectively silences the voices of millions of Americans. pic.twitter.com/okg97Tec6k,1204429845058465793,2019-12-10,15:57:06,replarrybucshon,17,6,10

I am pleased to stand with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to provide relief to Hoosiers who are tired of annoying robocalls.

The heavy-hand of government which stymies the development of future cures is not the way to lower drug prices. I supported bipartisan solutions which Speaker Pelosi refuses to bring to the House floor in a way that can be signed into law. https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/house-drug-pricing-bill-keep-100-lifesaving-drugs-american-patients/?utm_source=116th+Legislative+Digest&utm_campaign=b0b1d87caf-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_01_09_03_21_COPY_34&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0258ddd81e-b0b1d87caf-147447345 …,1201957831353798657,2019-12-03,20:14:12,replarrybucshon,8,1,5
