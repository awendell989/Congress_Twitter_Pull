The resolution is not the end of this critical conversation. It is vital that we have a full discussion in the next Congress on the crisis and work toward a reasonable solution that I hope will bring an end to the atrocities taking place in Yemen.,1073245661053812737,2018-12-13,15:58:00,repallawsonjr,97,1,7
It's unfortunate my Republican colleagues played political games by attaching a measure as serious as the humanitarian crisis occurring in Yemen to the Farm bill. This was Congress’ last chance before the end of the year to provide much-needed relief to families through the Bill.,1073245457311244290,2018-12-13,15:57:11,repallawsonjr,88,9,17
I’m pleased that the House has worked to provide certainty to those fighting hunger and farmers by passing a bipartisan Farm Bill. #FarmBill,1072984975262314497,2018-12-12,22:42:07,repallawsonjr,237,5,22
