The shooting at #GilroyGarlicFestival is heartbreaking. So much tragedy with each shooting in America. So many victims to mourn.  #Gilroyshooting is a reminder that we can’t accept this as normal. https://twitter.com/katiecouric/status/1155846758456598531 …,1155922713329983489,2019-07-29,19:27:05,repgregorymeeks,1,1,6

With my New York colleagues and @SpeakerPelosi to sign the full reauthorization of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. New York and indeed our nation stands by our brave first responders.

"Whether Swami Ji Harish Chander Puri was assaulted because of how he looked or what he believed, ultimately it was for the simple fact of being different from his attacker.

"It comes as no surprise that Trump doubled down on racism.
