Heartbroken and disturbed by this attack on a synagogue. My thoughts are with the victims and the community. Our nation must take seriously the rise in hate crimes and prejudice that is culminating into attacks like this one. https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1122246878391877632 …,1122253198968983553,2019-04-27,21:36:27,repgregorymeeks,2,5,17

One pesky contributor to the wealth gap is the underbanked’s lack of full access to affordable and safe financial services.
