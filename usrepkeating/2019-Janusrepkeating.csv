The Department of Homeland Security has many responsibilities and contributing to the Terrorist Screening Database is one of them.

Thursday was a great day for our nation - Speaker Pelosi took the gavel to preside over a new majority and the most diverse Congress in history with her grandchildren and the children of many other members by her side.
