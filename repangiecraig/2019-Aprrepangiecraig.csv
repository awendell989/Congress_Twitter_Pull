The bill I introduced with @RepScottPeters to lower health insurance costs passed out of the Energy & Commerce committee last night! The next step is a vote on the House floor - bringing us one step closer to lowering health insurance costs for families across #MN02.,1113805102891057153,2019-04-04,14:06:44,repangiecraig,5,8,34
"Land O’ Lakes employs thousands of people across MN, supporting farmers and creating good paying jobs across #MN02.

I'm proud to support @RepColinAllred’s resolution against attacks on our current healthcare system. We can’t go back to the days when folks with pre-existing conditions had nowhere to turn for healthcare. We must continue working for more affordable healthcare for every family.,1113501665867571201,2019-04-03,18:00:59,repangiecraig,0,9,25

That’s why I was proud to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairnessAct and vote to pass it out of the House last week. We must make #PaycheckFairnessAct a law now! pic.twitter.com/uhrZJuUIVi,1113144343932620805,2019-04-02,18:21:07,repangiecraig,0,4,20
"April 2 is #EqualPayDay, which is how long into this year it takes women catch up to what men were paid in the previous year. On average, women are paid just 80 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts.  For women of color, the #wagegap is much larger.",1113144167805452290,2019-04-02,18:20:25,repangiecraig,1,7,20

"Whether I’m talking to farmers, families, students, or business owners, I hear the same thing: if healthcare isn’t affordable, it’s not accessible.
