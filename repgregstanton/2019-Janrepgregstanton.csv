1 in 3 young people grow up without a mentor—let’s change that. Thanks to the team from @MENTORnational for stopping by to talk about investing in quality youth mentoring. We’ll hang up our @FreeArtsAZ artwork as a daily reminder to support the next generation of leaders. pic.twitter.com/Ue8qbCC7YV,1090733491560562689,2019-01-30,22:08:23,repgregstanton,0,1,8

"56 years after the Equal Pay Act, pay discrimination is still very real. Women make only 80 cents for every $1 a man earns, and the gap is wider for women of color. I'm proud to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairness Act, an important step forward for women, families and our economy.",1090631159464251392,2019-01-30,15:21:46,repgregstanton,2,8,21

The annual @uamedphx #Connect2STEM gives young people an up-close look at careers in science and technology. I’m inspired by the volunteers who put together this event to give so many students their first exposure to STEM opportunities in college and beyond. #azscitech pic.twitter.com/5hpiUFE685,1089215256319221765,2019-01-26,17:35:28,repgregstanton,0,7,32
"Over the weekend, I met with nonprofit leaders in Arizona who work with victims of domestic violence. Their federal funding is critical, and without it, some are being forced to turn people away.

But they also shared with me their new stark reality: Coming home with no paycheck in sight is hurting their families. Some are considering paying penalties to dip into retirement. Others are concerned about accessing their health care benefits. The effects are serious and real. pic.twitter.com/O4FRQ7dDjc,1087522295688646657,2019-01-22,01:28:15,repgregstanton,4,0,4
