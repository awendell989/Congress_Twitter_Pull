I’m proud to lead the #Senate effort to name April as Second Chance Month. The mistakes of our past don’t have to define the potential of our future.

Students shouldn’t have to sacrifice an education for housing & this bill will work to ensure students can have both. http://sparechangenews.net/2019/04/bill-would-offer-college-path-to-homeless-and-youths-in-foster-care/ …,1112741222702088192,2019-04-01,15:39:15,senrobportman,15,4,11
