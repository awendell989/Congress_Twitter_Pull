"The alternative to passing the bipartisan budget agreement was another govt shutdown or short-term CR, which would have hurt our bases in #Ohio like @WrightPattAFB, #JSMC in #Lima, Camp James A. Garfield & the @910AW, Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base, @180thFW & more. #Ohio",1156976276864983041,2019-08-01,17:13:34,senrobportman,17,5,16

"I’m pleased that the legislation is included in the #SECUREAct, but we are introducing it as a stand-alone bill as well to send a message about its urgency.
