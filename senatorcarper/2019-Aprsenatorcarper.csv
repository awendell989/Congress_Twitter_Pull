"For my family, #Alzheimers is an issue that hits home. My mother had it. Her mother and her grandmother had it. I know firsthand that Alzheimer‚Äôs is a heartbreaking disease‚Äîfor those afflicted with it, and for those who love them.
 
I also know we in Congress can do more to help.",1113185328247042048,2019-04-02,21:03:58,senatorcarper,4,12,35
"Still, in 2019, women in Delaware, and throughout the nation, on average make 80 cents to every dollar men make for the same work.

".@realDonaldTrump has it wrong. Families in Central America are arriving at the border because they are fleeing for their lives.

Families arriving at the U.S. Southern border are fleeing unspeakable violence.

"Well, that's just entirely untrue, @realDonaldTrump. An accurate #2020Census will impact decisions made at all levels of our government and at businesses that drive our economy.

"Last month, @RepDonBeyer and I traveled with our colleagues to the Northern Triangle to see firsthand the conditions that force so many in the region to flee for their lives and seek safe haven at our Southern border.
