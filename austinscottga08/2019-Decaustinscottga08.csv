"Moments ago, the House passed #USMCA. I congratulate & thank @realDonaldTrump on securing this important trade deal, which passed with my support.

House Democrats have used sequencing & patterns to manufacture a sham case for impeachment of @realDonaldTrump. Their hatred for the President of the United States blinds them to the truth. I’ll be voting NO on articles of impeachment. #ImpeachmentSham pic.twitter.com/jRTBj87jjK,1207380886309818371,2019-12-18,19:23:30,austinscottga08,40,155,363

"Yesterday, @RepAdamSchiff's Counsel admitted to @RepDougCollins to using sequencing & patterns to build a circumstantial case. 

The facts are not on their side, but still they move forward w/ their partisan, baseless #ShamImpeachment. Their hatred of @realDonaldTrump has no end. pic.twitter.com/8N83TZnd06",1204449852261883906,2019-12-10,17:16:37,austinscottga08,9,7,30

Profs without proof. Not a single one of yesterday’s legal professors had any personal knowledge of a single fact in Adam Schiff’s report. This has been a factless personal attack against President Trump from the start. #ShamImpeachment https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1202338864825851916 …,1202613781047783424,2019-12-05,15:40:43,austinscottga08,6,17,27
This new rule will provide a pathway off the program for many able-bodied adults without dependents while giving them tools to climb the economic ladder.
