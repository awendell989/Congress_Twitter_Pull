Another issue (1 of many) I have with the Dems’ support of the ACA is the lie they spread that you can sign-up for insurance whenever you have the need. That is blatantly false. Individuals can only sign-up during open enrollment which only runs for a couple of weeks each yr.,1114290162412982272,2019-04-05,22:14:11,austinscottga08,1,2,8
