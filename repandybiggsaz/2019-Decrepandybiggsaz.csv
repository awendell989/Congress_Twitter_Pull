"🚨 THE REPORT IS OUT 🚨

The facts are on @POTUS @realDonaldTrump’s side. No evidence to support the Democrats’ never-ending, obtuse, and partisan impeachment claims.

Time for Democrats to put country before politics and end their inquisition.  https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-02-Report-of-Evidence-in-the-Democrats-Impeachment-Inquiry-in-the-House-of-Representatives.pdf …",1201639954734092290,2019-12-02,23:11:05,repandybiggsaz,66,604,1298

"100% not the case. Chairman Adam Schiff bent over backwards to keep the President’s counsel from his secret, Soviet-style hearings and then his so-called “public” hearings. That’s when @realDonaldTrump’s counsel should have been in the room to start. https://twitter.com/Olivia_Beavers/status/1201582103248420865 …",1201587966503723008,2019-12-02,19:44:30,repandybiggsaz,46,550,1122

It's awfully late in the proceedings to try to rehabilitate this sham of a process - especially since Chairman Nadler hasn't even disclosed to the committee who his witnesses will be & the Intel report hasn't even been seen by members of that committee. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-says-trump-wont-participate-in-judiciary-hearing …,1201323245254795266,2019-12-02,02:12:35,repandybiggsaz,145,1335,3585
