Democrats continue to play politics w/ our nat'l security & have utter disregard for the most innocent among us. I encourage the Senate to reject this most recent proposal that House Democrats passed last night. I encourage @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to remain firm to his promises. pic.twitter.com/ivCH5ueJvy,1081218963114262528,2019-01-04,16:01:03,repandybiggsaz,69,77,227
