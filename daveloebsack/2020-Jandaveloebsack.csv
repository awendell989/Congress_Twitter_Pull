"Very pleased that 10 years after its closure, there is finally a plan for former Knoxville VA Campus! The old campus will be transferred to Marion County. I look forward to seeing what the property will be used for in the future! @DeptVetAffairs @USGSA https://www.journalexpress.net/news/local_news/future-of-va-campus-to-be-shared/article_11ffa7fe-36ee-11ea-97d4-b3b2191897ad.html …",1217544129850355712,2020-01-15,20:28:36,daveloebsack,2,5,5
"I'm pleased @USGAO accepted our request to open an investigation into small refinery exemptions under the RFS.

I look forward to seeing the results. https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/blogs/ethanol-blog/blog-post/2020/01/10/gao-will-investigate-small-refinery …",1215755738087350275,2020-01-10,22:02:10,daveloebsack,3,6,10

Today we honor the men & women in blue! One of my favorite things to do is to go on a ride along with local law enforcement officers. There isn't a better way to see what is happening in your community. Thanks to all who serve! #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay pic.twitter.com/n2HKslQMNZ,1215307917848727557,2020-01-09,16:22:41,daveloebsack,1,5,12
