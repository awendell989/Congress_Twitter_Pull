Saddened to hear of former Senator Culver’s passing. We are thankful for his years of service on behalf of our state and nation. My thoughts and prayers go to the Culver family and loved ones.  https://qctimes.com/news/state-and-regional/iowa/john-c-culver-who-represented-iowa-in-congress-dies-at/article_0551853c-1757-523f-b813-7d48a321601b.html#tracking-source=home-breaking …,1078424829982838787,2018-12-27,22:58:10,daveloebsack,0,6,16

Saddened & very concerned to see General Mattis resign as Secretary of Defense. His informed and wise counsel will be sorely missed. POTUS needs to use this opportunity to rethink seriously his approach to the world and the manner in which he makes his decisions.,1076126820867678208,2018-12-21,14:46:42,daveloebsack,4,1,23
