Robocalls aren’t just annoying. Many are outright frauds looking to extract personal information or trick Americans into giving up their hard-earned money. It’s time to get rid of these calls. That’s why I helped the #StopBadRobocalls Act pass the House! pic.twitter.com/SwYh8AzaGZ,1154456576389865473,2019-07-25,18:21:11,daveloebsack,4,2,15
