We're making sure their hard earned dollars aren’t unknowingly used to pay for another person’s abortion: https://www.conservativereview.com/news/huge-pro-life-victory-trump-admin-takes-aim-abortion-surcharge-hidden-obamacare-plans/ …,1208104101273313280,2019-12-20,19:17:17,repcloudtx,3,20,60
"Historically, impeachment proceedings have been very deliberate, defined, and transparent, but this investigation was conducted in a top-secret room in the basement of the Capitol, having neither bipartisan support nor the basic norms of due process and fairness.

"Despite unfair and, even at times, secret hearings, this impeachment investigation uncovered no evidence that the president committed impeachable offenses. This is a single-party effort in Congress to remove a sitting president. (1/2)",1207477534490865666,2019-12-19,01:47:32,repcloudtx,190,446,1718

"Excited to see my bill to help our veterans pass today with bipartisan support. It's going to improve the quality of healthcare veterans receive from the VA.

"Truth, transparency, and justice have been lacking throughout this entire process.

Denying the minority a hearing is just the latest example. https://twitter.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1204520462350467079 …",1204535205375160320,2019-12-10,22:55:46,repcloudtx,71,198,653
