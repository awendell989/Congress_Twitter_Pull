"This weekend we saw white nationalist terrorism, facilitated by powerful military style rifles. These weapons of war have no place in civilian hands. We also need to take racist violence and radicalism far more seriously. This is a critical national security issue.",1158717356014653440,2019-08-06,12:32:00,replowenthal,7,5,38

No one who works full time should live in poverty. Congress passed the Raise the Wage Act to responsibly raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2025. We can lift 1.3 million people out of poverty.

The fight against climate change will define our future. We need to mobilize to cut dangerous carbon pollution and to prepare for the impacts of extreme weather and sea level rise.
