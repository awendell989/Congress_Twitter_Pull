I was proud to earn the Wireless Workforce Champion Award from @WIAorg. This award combines two of my priorities in Congress – expanding broadband access and helping Kentuckians find jobs. https://twitter.com/WIAorg/status/1196543289215860736 …,1196789763879161856,2019-11-19,13:58:09,repguthrie,0,21,20
Great news from @HouseCommerce: We officially have a House-Senate agreement on an anti-robocall bill. I look forward to supporting the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act. https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/press-release/house-senate-announce-agreement-on-anti-robocall-bill/ …,1195459232621113355,2019-11-15,21:51:06,repguthrie,3,28,22
