It is a sad day in the U.S. House this morning as we learn of the death of my colleague Rep. Elijah Cummings. Rep. Cummings was a civil rights warrior and always worked hard for his constituents. I am praying for his family and loved ones today.,1184820789251575808,2019-10-17,13:17:43,repguthrie,4,5,29
