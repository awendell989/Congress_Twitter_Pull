The House has passed several bills to expand #BackgroundChecks & reduce #GunViolence. All are gathering dust on #MitchMcConnell’s desk. #McConnell should call the Senate back into session to do their job. pic.twitter.com/fbQ2Nr34O5,1158482980685393921,2019-08-05,21:00:40,repjoecourtney,5,10,18

My friend @repjohnlarson is right — Mitch McConnell must bring the Senate back to act on House-passed background checks bills. It’s time for the senate to do something. https://twitter.com/RepJohnLarson/status/1158087558598975488 …,1158092434347319299,2019-08-04,19:08:47,repjoecourtney,1,10,27
The cowardly slaughter of innocents in El Paso and Dayton has to be met with more than ‘thoughts and prayers.’ Our country can and must do more.,1158019404485091330,2019-08-04,14:18:35,repjoecourtney,9,11,46
I agree with @SOTSMerrill – it’s incredible that the Senate has adjourned without acting on House-passed #ElectionSecurity legislation. Mitch McConnell can’t sit back and do nothing in the face of ongoing threats to our elections. https://bit.ly/2ZAQmrq ,1157732193449512961,2019-08-03,19:17:19,repjoecourtney,1,11,22
