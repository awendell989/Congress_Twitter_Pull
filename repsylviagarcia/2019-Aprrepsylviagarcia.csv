"Proud to fight against @realDonaldTrump's #healthcare lawsuit
It would:
➡️Rip away protections for ppl w/ pre-existing conditions
➡️Steal health care from millions 
➡️Allow insurers to put lifetime & annual limits on your health coverage
Democrats are voting to #ProtectOurCare!",1113492318085107712,2019-04-03,17:23:50,repsylviagarcia,1,3,7

"I'm proud to join @RepColinAllred in voting for #HRes271. Trump and the GOP's repeated attacks on #HealthCare and protections for pre-existing conditions are abhorrent. 

I will do everything I can to make sure that @realDonaldTrump does not succeed in his #HealthCareSabotage.",1113126919447474176,2019-04-02,17:11:53,repsylviagarcia,0,1,3

"The only #BorderCrisis we have is a crisis of leadership.
Trade through our #SouthernBorder accounts for $1.5 Billion per day.
And cutting off aid will only drive more migrants to the US.
