"Throughout American history, the labor movement has fought for the dignity of American workers across the country. 

However, there is still more work to be done to make sure that one job is enough for people to provide for their families. #LaborDay2019 pic.twitter.com/1UrHOZaP6r",1168543345318211587,2019-09-02,15:16:58,repsylviagarcia,2,2,4

".@VP here‚Äôs an idea:

You can honor the victims of today‚Äôs shooting with action. Urge McConnell to allow a vote on HR 8 and HR 1112.

"Heart breaking. A 17 month old toddler was among the victims at today‚Äôs #midlandshooting.

@senatemajldr: How many more people will you allow to die with your inaction?

Allow a vote on gun control legislation in the Senate. #DoSomething #EndGunViolence https://twitter.com/newswest9/status/1167929150671179781¬†‚Ä¶",1167952772429275136,2019-09-01,00:10:15,repsylviagarcia,46,204,363
