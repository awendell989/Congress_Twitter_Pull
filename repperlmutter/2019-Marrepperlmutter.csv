"Want big money out of politics?

Want clean and fair elections?

Want public servants to serve the public, not themselves or special interests?

Consumers should have the info they need to make important medical decisions for themselves & their family. I intro'd a bill this week to make the healthcare pricing more transparent-a key part of Congress' work to stabilize the ACA & reduce costs overall. https://on.mktw.net/2Tq22Nu ,1102260094815727616,2019-03-03,17:31:00,repperlmutter,7,4,38

Trying to enact common sense reforms to #EndGunViolence is better than continuing to do nothing. I'm glad Colorado is acting on this issue as well as @HouseDemocrats with the passage of #HR8 and #HR1112 this week. #HonorWithAction #EnoughIsEnough https://dpo.st/2IFP3Dr ,1101309833700085760,2019-03-01,02:35:00,repperlmutter,9,4,23
