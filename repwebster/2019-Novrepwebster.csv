"I just spoke on the House Floor in opposition to H.R. 737 which would have a devastating effect on responsible American fishermen, including many in my district who have made sacrifices to conserve and rebuild our shark populations. http://bit.ly/2QCIrYX ",1197253371843031041,2019-11-20,20:40:22,repwebster,2,1,4
I voted against the Continuing Resolution in the House today. Once again Congress abdicated its chief responsibility to pass a responsible funding bill. Hardworking American voters and our military deserve better than this.,1196894484803522560,2019-11-19,20:54:17,repwebster,8,3,8
"I and several of my colleagues, have studied these cases and advocated on behalf of these veterans.

I’m joining Mike Reeves in a few minutes to talk about latest happenings in Democrats’ soviet-style impeachment of @realDonaldTrump and everything that isn’t getting done for American voters because of it.

.@realDonaldTrump signed #USMCA about a year ago. It is time for @SpeakerPelosi to allow a vote and for Congress to pass this new trade agreement. The USMCA is a win for American workers across the country.,1194639358101479425,2019-11-13,15:33:12,repwebster,3,0,5
Canada and Mexico purchase more than 1/10 of Florida’s total global manufacturing exports. The passage of USMCA is critical for allowing more Sunshine State businesses to sell more of what they make to consumers around the world. #USMCAnow pic.twitter.com/5gDCjodw5P,1194638631262203905,2019-11-13,15:30:19,repwebster,1,2,7

Incredible turnout at Pennbrooke Fairways ceremony honoring veterans. Their service has not come without sacrifice. We owe our military men and women a debt we can never repay. pic.twitter.com/HY6G9rgnO1,1193924042643922947,2019-11-11,16:10:48,repwebster,2,5,10
30 years ago today. It was victory for democracy and a defeat for communism. The fall of the Berlin Wall is an example and reminder of a peoples’ desire for freedom and liberty. https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1193171374443028480 …,1193194750620454915,2019-11-09,15:52:51,repwebster,30,49,160
