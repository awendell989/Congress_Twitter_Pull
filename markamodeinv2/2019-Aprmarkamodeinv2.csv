Had a great discussion with a group of #Nevada scouts last night about the importance of our #Constitution. Thank you for the great questions! I always enjoy meeting with young leaders who are actively engaged in civics and eager to learn more about our nationâ€™s government. pic.twitter.com/UEcaEIHgLx,1116724124544581632,2019-04-12,15:25:53,markamodeinv2,8,4,10
#TBT to the Summer of 1980 & my days as an intern for the late Senator Laxalt. Can you find me? I've always looked up to Sen Laxalt as an example of character & appreciated his determination to always do right by Nevadans. His legacy is certainly something we can all learn fromðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ pic.twitter.com/WztDj4PM6V,1113846177211006976,2019-04-04,16:49:57,markamodeinv2,20,6,38
