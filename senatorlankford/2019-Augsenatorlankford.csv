Glad to join @mariabartiromo on @FoxBusiness to discuss my bill w/@SenatorHassan to stop government shutdowns. Maria also asked about today’s vote on the budget deal. I explained why I can’t support a bill that does not include a plan to pay down our national debt. pic.twitter.com/Df0xBwxAWK,1156955226781442049,2019-08-01,15:49:55,senatorlankford,18,8,44
