Time and time again Iâ€™ve heard from producers - Washington needs to step it up. I applaud @SecretarySonny for directing @USDA to investigate the cattle markets. https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/08/28/secretary-perdue-statement-beef-processing-facility-holcomb-kansasÂ â€¦,1166831988579418114,2019-08-28,21:56:39,repdustyjohnson,4,0,2

"The highlight of my morning in Eagle Butte has been meeting Mason. 

He is a 13-year-old entrepreneur who has been mowing lawns since he was 9. Hearing Mason talk about his hard work and plans for expansion brought a huge smile to my face. pic.twitter.com/BtxD1izS9b",1166773744641171457,2019-08-28,18:05:12,repdustyjohnson,1,0,29

Excellent news for our farmers and ranchers. @realDonaldTrump is securing historic market access with Japan â€“ China should follow Japanâ€™s lead and come to the table for a trade deal with the US. https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1165640802455961603Â â€¦,1166151991371816960,2019-08-27,00:54:35,repdustyjohnson,14,1,18

Iâ€™m pleased the @USDOT has proposed a rule to enhance road safety and increase flexibility for our nationâ€™s truck drivers. Our truck drivers should not be inhibited by overburdensome regulations and this is a step in the right direction. https://twitter.com/FMCSA/status/1161640058199429120Â â€¦,1163862181806596097,2019-08-20,17:15:42,repdustyjohnson,1,0,8
