Democrats’ dishonest desire to impeach @realDonaldTrump has nothing to do w Ukraine or some imagined abuse of power. They’ve been trying to impeach since day one as revenge for winning the 2016 election. https://twitter.com/HouseGOP/status/1189958461955739648 …,1189965353838940161,2019-10-31,18:00:23,repbobgibbs,72,317,542

So the whistleblower took second-hand allegations to Adam Schiff's office before going through the appropriate channels at the CIA and they want us to think it's NOT a politically motivated farce?
