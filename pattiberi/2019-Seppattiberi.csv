"The world is a less better place today with the loss of Kurt Tunnell. I knew Kurt for thirty years and there were none better. A humble, kind man who made the people around him better.  He helped lift public officials and lawyers to a higher level. God Bless the Tunnell family. https://twitter.com/ohiobrt/status/1167926833888673792 …",1167960745608245248,2019-09-01,00:41:56,pattiberi,2,1,49
