"Just spent 20 min w Steve & Johnny (super nice guys) who are setting up a farm stand in Durham. They wanted to know why illegal immigrants can burn the Bible & flag, get free college & health care, & the rest of us get none of that.

About 22 miles into today‚Äôs segment of my annual walk across Connecticut and I have two primary thoughts: a) my legs really really hurt; 2) CT is a very pedestrian unfriendly state (the shoulders I walk on are on average 17 centimeters wide). #WalkCT,1146167442563108864,2019-07-02,21:23:07,chrismurphyct,89,52,850

"Mostly the national headlines don‚Äôt come up w the people I meet on my walk across CT. It‚Äôs almost always wages, taxes and schools.

Just met Giselle in Naugatuck. She makes $15/hr working at a home for the disabled. She has 3 kids and her rent is $1300/mo. That‚Äôs about 2/3 of her monthly take home income. Tell me how anyone can live like that? #WalkCT,1146052202697580544,2019-07-02,13:45:12,chrismurphyct,392,740,3878
