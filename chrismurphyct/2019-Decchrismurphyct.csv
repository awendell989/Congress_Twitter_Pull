"The Trump-Macron break is not just a war of words. Take Trump‚Äôs anti-Iran maritime security effort, Operation Sentinel. EU nations refuse to join and Macron is organizing a competing version.

"It shouldn‚Äôt have taken a trip from a U.S. Senator and a public shaming campaign to unlock aid for Lebanon. 

The founders gave Congress foreign policy powers as a check against an imperial presidency. 

Where are all those Republicans who used to care about executive overreach?",1201695914706055170,2019-12-03,02:53:27,chrismurphyct,273,2815,10601

Just stunning. Holding the money weakened the Lebanese military just at the moment that they were holding the country together.

"The situation in Lebanon is eerily similar to Ukraine: the Trump administration is illegally holding up congressionally appropriated aid with no explanation.

"The brutal crackdown on protesters throughout the Middle East underscores how unique the Lebanese Armed Forces are. They view their mission as protecting, not attacking the protesters.
