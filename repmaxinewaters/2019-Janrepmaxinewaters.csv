"When are the people of this country going to wake up to the fact that this president is a disgusting liar, documented to have lied over 8,000 times in 2 yrs? Add to that his recent, blatant lies on our nation's intel chiefs' testimony in the US Senate. Past time for impeachment!",1091120715909210112,2019-01-31,23:47:05,repmaxinewaters,12316,22847,89367
Jussie is my friend - a very talented & beautiful human being. It is so hurtful that homophobic haters would dare hurt someone so loving and giving. I'm dedicated to finding the culprits and bringing them to justice. Jussie did not deserve to be harmed by anyone!,1090446736848535552,2019-01-30,03:08:56,repmaxinewaters,7021,11844,77894

"UPDATE: Within 24hrs of my Tweet, @CBSNews reps met w/ me on Capitol Hill.

CBS admitted they had a lot of work to do & committed to including Blacks on their 2020 election team & all other teams.

True diversity is the inclusion of ALL.

I won't let them off the hook! pic.twitter.com/K11Esx0gHG",1085373902979776512,2019-01-16,03:11:18,repmaxinewaters,2225,8394,46587
"CBS, the efforts on your website about your support for diversity fly in the face of your display of all of the reporters you've selected for the 2020 campaign. Not one Black. What's up with this? An explanation is needed.",1084825011175723008,2019-01-14,14:50:12,repmaxinewaters,1449,6263,27720
"Trump, you didn't get $5 billion to carry out your ill advised election promise & now you want to declare an emergency. The only emergency facing our country is the need to impeach you before you destroy our country, our ideals, & leadership in the world. Trump, go home. Bye bye!",1084659166160003072,2019-01-14,03:51:11,repmaxinewaters,6420,22285,89679
"Back in 2017, I dubbed Trump & his allies w/ all their ties to Russia and Ukraine, the ""Kremlin Klan"".  I believed Trump colluded with Russians & has been obstructing justice before our eyes.  What more do we need to see?  https://youtu.be/SoXRSvK09j8  via @YouTube",1084658135577571329,2019-01-14,03:47:06,repmaxinewaters,1272,3797,11303
No surprise the FBI questioned Trump's allegiance to US! He meets w/ Putin 5 times in secret w/ no readout; gave Russians classified info in WH; disregarded US intel on Russia; praised Putin's election; lies abt his deals in Russia. Is there any question Trump is a Russian agent?,1084657722325377024,2019-01-14,03:45:27,repmaxinewaters,2907,12866,42259
"Trump has perfected the art of lying. No, #ConManDon, the FBI investigation hanging over your head is no witch hunt. You are engulfed in a web of lies & deceit. Webs are created by poisonous & dangerous spiders. You fit the profile.",1084657371991953408,2019-01-14,03:44:04,repmaxinewaters,1001,4739,16466
Please. No one should wonder why Manafort gave polling data to Russians. The only reason Russians wanted this info was to use it against H. Clinton in support of Trump. Why do you think Manafort w/ all his ties to Russia & Ukraine was in the campaign to begin with? Stay woke!,1084657098615648256,2019-01-14,03:42:58,repmaxinewaters,1167,11544,42312
"Americans should be shaken by what we know of Trump & Putin's relationship & should NOT be surprised by the FBI counterintelligence investigation. Is Trump a Russian agent? If it walks like a duck & talks like a duck, then it is a duck - and the duck should be impeached.",1084656623723954176,2019-01-14,03:41:05,repmaxinewaters,2872,12388,43022
"Trump, even your most vocal defenders will turn on you w/ your shutdown when there's no food on the table, the rent is not paid, the car is repossessed, & the children need shoes. No American who works for our govt should be treated this way while you are living off the govt.",1084656258823741440,2019-01-14,03:39:38,repmaxinewaters,3007,13118,46245
