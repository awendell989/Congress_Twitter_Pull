"Outrage! Judge Day ordered release of a white supremacist who threatened to kill me, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Rep. AOC, Rep. Omar, pres candidates, & journalists! 15 guns found in his home & he has ties to other neo-Nazis. Why is Barr silent? What must we do?

"Trump's campaign chair gave polling data to Kilimnik who was tied to the Kremlin. Manafort, Don Jr, Kushner, & Flynn met w/ Russians during campaign. Collusion is obvious. Obstruction of justice is well defined in Mueller report. Trump said game over. No, the game has just begun!",1120786894680481792,2019-04-23,20:29:53,repmaxinewaters,1279,4570,12195
Putin & the Kremlin are even now interfering w/ our election systems. They were proven to have undermined our 2016 elections & evidence shows they will do the same in 2020 --ALL in support of Trump. Trump won't criticize or stop them. Congress must stop them & #ImpeachTrump!,1120786316260716544,2019-04-23,20:27:35,repmaxinewaters,807,2589,5792
"Mueller kicked the impeachment ball to the Congress. The Constitution gives the responsibility to Congress to impeach an unfit president - ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" What more do we need? #impeach45",1120785914328965120,2019-04-23,20:25:59,repmaxinewaters,2367,8134,29470
Ninety percent of the calls and mail I'm receiving in my office support impeachment of Trump and so do I. Dems divided. The impeachment resolution must start with & be taken up by the Judiciary Committee. Rep. Nadler is the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.,1120785364145311751,2019-04-23,20:23:48,repmaxinewaters,4756,6209,24571
"I received some criticism b/c I said Repubs supporting Trump -after his crimes & work w/ Russians - are unpatriotic. Yes I said it! How can you know the enemy Russia is undermining our democracy & say & do nothing? If you don't care, I do. We must impeach Putin's president Trump!",1120784878411362306,2019-04-23,20:21:52,repmaxinewaters,21056,24094,97268
"Another strike against Treasury Sec. Mnuchin. Sears sued Mnuchin, claiming that he was among the board members who helped the CEO strip Sears of $2 BILLION in assets. Wow! Trump, his cabinet, & his inner circle show up in so many fraudulent efforts! Are they all crooks?",1120783320357441536,2019-04-23,20:15:41,repmaxinewaters,4250,12779,37229
"CFPB Dir. Kraninger claimed she went on a listening tour.  She apparently thinks consumers don't need protection from banks, credit card companies & lenders, rather, consumers just need to learn to protect themselves. She is WRONG & I will continue to fight to protect consumers!",1120781976481554432,2019-04-23,20:10:20,repmaxinewaters,176,760,2485
ICYMI: My statement on the release of the redacted #Mueller report by AG Barr pic.twitter.com/b7yjKNTi8E,1119037481507328001,2019-04-19,00:38:20,repmaxinewaters,1445,2982,7917
"Barr said the words ""no collusion, no collusion"" straight out of the mouth of Trump. No attempt to hide his continuing defense of the President using the President's own words. How much more of a lackey can he be? FAKE AG!",1118894946537414656,2019-04-18,15:11:57,repmaxinewaters,2140,5393,18689
Barr auditioned for the job. He said he would protect Trump and that is what he has done. We demand Mueller's public testimony and review of his report NOT Barr's twisted interpretations!,1118894522249949186,2019-04-18,15:10:16,repmaxinewaters,647,1624,5055
Barr made a point of defending the President by describing Trump's pressure & frustration b/c of criticism. It's not the AG's job to protect a President who refused an interview by the Special Counsel! Barr is simply continuing his ongoing defense & protection of the President!,1118893669019471872,2019-04-18,15:06:53,repmaxinewaters,519,1141,3601
"As I stated last night on MSNBC, the American people shouldn't have expected Barr to do anything more than what he did: protect Trump. Barr has been acting as Trump's defense atty, not AG. Barr's performance was outrageously disrespectful of the Constitution & the American public",1118892689934749697,2019-04-18,15:02:59,repmaxinewaters,3361,10962,37853
