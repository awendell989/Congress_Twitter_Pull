"The court’s decision on McGahn gives us hope, but no guarantees. The Trump lawyers will appeal the decision and we don’t know yet what the outcome is going to be. Keep hope alive!",1199343905252073475,2019-11-26,15:07:24,repmaxinewaters,398,343,1850
"Lindsey, how can you say you love Biden? You don’t have a clue what love means. If you loved him, you wouldn’t be lying & using all this energy trying to harm him & protect the lying Prez who you really love b/c you want him to save your Senate seat. You don’t know what love is!",1199331562799677441,2019-11-26,14:18:21,repmaxinewaters,1963,5208,25781
"Rick Perry (TX) has lost his mind! He said Trump was “chosen” by God. Is that the same God who told him to go to Ukraine & give Zelensky a list of people to “trust” which led to 2 of his supporters getting an oil deal from Ukraine, despite being outbid? Subpoena Rick Perry too!",1199330672147664898,2019-11-26,14:14:49,repmaxinewaters,788,3005,11020
Nunes is an unhinged liar! He knows he met with Shokin in Vienna. This sounds like the midnight visit to the White House to try and prove a lie against Obama. Remember that? Parnas is going to out Nunes. Impeachment proceedings will reveal him and his lies.,1199010382662291460,2019-11-25,17:02:06,repmaxinewaters,680,2442,7399
Never in my wildest dreams did I think the GOP would become the spokespersons for Russian propaganda. Dr. Fiona Hill (fmr. WH advisor to Trump) chastised Repubs & used her expertise to confirm they’re simply being Putin’s stooges. Drain the swamp! Impeachment is the only answer!,1199010206266675200,2019-11-25,17:01:24,repmaxinewaters,356,1402,4854
"When you have all US intel agencies  confirming Russia led by Putin hacked the DNC & interfered in US election & Russian apologists like Sen.

"The public is fed up w/ the lies of Pompeo, Giuliani, Mulvaney, Bolton, Perry & AG Barr. Our democracy is at stake & headed by an unhinged Prez, whose mental health has been questioned time & time again, while he has the codes to a nuclear catastrophe.  Impeachment could save all",1199009385130995712,2019-11-25,16:58:08,repmaxinewaters,950,4252,15398

"Trump brags about not settling & winning lawsuits. Lied again! A judge just ordered him to pay $2 mil in damages (to REAL nonprofits) for using Trump Foundation to pay debts, aid his campaign & buy a $10K self portrait! He stole the $$$ and got caught! One of many crimes!",1192966300764721153,2019-11-09,00:45:05,repmaxinewaters,732,4026,15498
Trump is so desperate. He has stooped so low so as to try and force the patriotic whistleblower to be exposed so that he can bully and threaten them as he always does. Too late. The impeachment train is coming!,1192965981896880128,2019-11-09,00:43:48,repmaxinewaters,3472,8706,47679
"Can you believe racist Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is running to come back to the Senate? Sessions has no respect for himself in the way he's singing Trump's praises who embarrassed him, called him a ""dumb southerner"", & threw him under the bus.

"Shoutout to my colleague Adam Schiff. He's doing a masterful job conducting hearings & releasing transcripts, & will bring back witnesses to testify publicly.

"GOP scrambling & can't get their lies straight. First they say no quid pro quo when Trump w/held mil. aid from Ukraine for dirt on Biden.
