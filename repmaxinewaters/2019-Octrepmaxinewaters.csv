Just this week we learned that Facebook continues to allow the Russians to meddle in our elections to boost Trump & attack his opponents. I called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before @FSCDems & today is the day I plan to get answers on his proposed #BigTechTakeover.

Misuse! Manipulation! Discrimination! Criminal Activity! Just a few of Facebook’s egregious offenses & now they have the nerve to launch a #BigTechTakeover in the form of a currency that could rival the U.S. Dollar?! Is it 10 o'clock yet? Mr. Zuckerberg & I have a lot to discuss.,1187008848214794240,2019-10-23,14:12:17,repmaxinewaters,270,815,3167
"No one is above the law including Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook has allowed election interference, released private data, violated civil rights laws, among other offenses & now they’re trying to launch a #BigTechTakover by creating this mysterious #ZuckBuck? Not on my watch! @FSCDems",1187008625786703872,2019-10-23,14:11:24,repmaxinewaters,367,1114,3597
Facebook wants to launch a #BigTechTakeover when it continues to serve as #PutinsPlatform to attack our democracy. Clearly the company can’t be trusted.

"Can you believe it? This brazen president is inviting the 7 most powerful countries in the world to hold its conference at his FAILING hotel in FL, the Trump Doral, disregarding the emoluments clause that's already the subject of two lawsuits?",1185264421188329473,2019-10-18,18:40:33,repmaxinewaters,6169,13506,61668
"Did CoS Mulvaney admit Trump told Ukraine's President, scratch my back and I'll scratch yours w/ $400 million in taxpayer money?",1185263242958065664,2019-10-18,18:35:52,repmaxinewaters,890,1745,6846
"It’s going to be difficult to sleep tonight & I know for many nights to come. My dear friend Rep. Elijah Cummings is gone. I’m going to miss him. He called me his mentor, but I considered him the finest public policymaker I ever worked with. Love you forever! #ElijahCummings",1184976603442503680,2019-10-17,23:36:52,repmaxinewaters,2920,11983,99567
"The more we learn, the more flabbergasted we are. Can you believe Pompeo was on the call w/ Trump when he was shaking down Ukraine's pres & attempting to find dirt on Biden? Was Pompeo also involved in hiding transcripts on a classified server? Impeachment will uncover the truth.",1179112212776001538,2019-10-01,19:13:53,repmaxinewaters,4208,8642,37968
"Trump has corrupted so many members of his admin. The lies, coverups, shaking down foreign countries & undermining our democracy will be recorded as one of the worst periods in the history of our country, all led by a dishonorable con man. Follow the facts, impeachment on the way",1179092507726098434,2019-10-01,17:55:34,repmaxinewaters,2172,4208,14644
"It’s certainly past time for Giuliani's docs/texts to have been subpoenaed by our committees. His brazen lies, outrageous distortions, & attempts to do anything Trump wants him to do have got to be stopped. His unintended revelations will help us solidify Trump's impeachment.",1179091348827320320,2019-10-01,17:50:58,repmaxinewaters,636,1763,6182
"AG Barr is the highest law enforcement officer & the worst. He's supposed to be the people’s lawyer, but he’s just Trump’s puppet. He's been caught soliciting foreign countries' help in undermining his FBI & our Intel agencies. He should be Trump’s companion w/impeachment.",1179084758996979714,2019-10-01,17:24:47,repmaxinewaters,1852,8209,30533
"I'm calling on the GOP to stop Trump's filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed. Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative.",1179083422712700928,2019-10-01,17:19:28,repmaxinewaters,19200,17004,70563
"Trump is so irresponsible & so hungry for power & control, he would dare imply that a civil war will ensue if he's impeached. He is dog whistling to his white supremacists to create fear & intimidation b/c he knows he is going to be impeached. He knows he deserves impeachment.",1179082814924439560,2019-10-01,17:17:04,repmaxinewaters,1494,4115,15313
