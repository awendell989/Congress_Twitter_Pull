We've been telling the story about Black women getting paid 61 cents to the dollar for more years than I can remember. And I can simply use this day to further shout to the top of my voice that it is time to end the discrepancy and discrimination. Black women deserve equal pay.,1164616348980432896,2019-08-22,19:12:29,repmaxinewaters,3289,7779,31624

We can walk & chew gum at the same time. While we’re dealing with Trump we must also keep our eye on good public policy. I invite all Los Angelenos to come to the @FSCdems hearing on homelessness tomorrow for a discussion on solutions to end homelessness.  https://go.usa.gov/xVxrN ,1161466608914767872,2019-08-14,02:36:33,repmaxinewaters,722,884,3370

"Yes, the House of Representatives has passed reasonable legislation on background checks. #MoscowMitch refuses to put the bills up for a vote. As reasonable as these two bills are, that's not enough. The entire Congress needs to pass legislation to get rid of all assault weapons.",1158760551272669185,2019-08-06,15:23:38,repmaxinewaters,694,1358,3424
"Americans, please stop tolerating the pain, suffering, and prayers of families, friends, neighborhoods & all caring Americans. Demand the Members of Congress get rid of ALL assault weapons or kick our a--- out of Congress!",1158760268404600832,2019-08-06,15:22:31,repmaxinewaters,3323,2635,8266
I remain shaken following the killings of the 20 innocent children at Sandy Hook in 2012.  I'm still numbed by the fact the NRA owns too many Members of Congress who don't have the courage to tell the NRA to go straight to hell!,1158759945162113026,2019-08-06,15:21:14,repmaxinewaters,2349,3463,13935
"The NRA is a right wing, corrupted, killer organization that does not care about the loss of somebody else's children and families.  All they care about is money, power, & holding fear over the heads of this entire country. The NRA must be disbanded!",1158759407070699520,2019-08-06,15:19:06,repmaxinewaters,18622,10186,39166
"I'm not letting law enforcement & elected officials off the hook about the constant black on black killings in Chicago. The weapons that are being used must be banned. The police must do a better job, and the community must demand & strongly support the end to gang violence.",1158758829347287040,2019-08-06,15:16:48,repmaxinewaters,2045,735,2922
"There are no words, thoughts, or prayers that can quell the unspeakable horror that has befallen the El Paso community. Shame on #Moscowmitch for taking no action on Dem gun violence prevention bill! Shame on Trump for stoking hatred, racism, & white nationalism. It must end!",1158046343358767104,2019-08-04,16:05:38,repmaxinewaters,5304,4329,13235
"Enough is enough. America, when are you going to demand action on guns? Another senseless mass killing by a young white nationalist. Trump, you cannot escape accepting blame for these escalating killings in our country that are motivated by your race baiting!",1158045972460707840,2019-08-04,16:04:09,repmaxinewaters,14495,7195,32413
"The El Paso white nationalist terrorist attacked a community w/ a large Mexican & immigrant population. The El Paso terrorist said in his manifesto Hispanics ""race mix"" & that this is another reason to ""send them back."" Did his words, ""send them back,"" sound familiar to anyone?",1158045695816941568,2019-08-04,16:03:03,repmaxinewaters,2093,1609,4403
"Don't forget, before 2018 midterms, Trump was screaming about immigrants crossing the border to invade the US! He calls them rapists & gang members. He demonizes Muslims, describes cities w/ large black populations as ""rat infested,"" & called African nations ""shitholes.""",1158045484734435328,2019-08-04,16:02:13,repmaxinewaters,1069,1540,4181
"Trump, you called the El Paso shooting an act of cowardice. Trump, you're the coward. You could use the bully pulpit to stop these horrific mass shootings, but you continue racist attacks on Americans. We can't let Senate off the hook. Pass the gun bill! Congress, we can do more!",1158045204659748868,2019-08-04,16:01:06,repmaxinewaters,13696,14040,58974
"Once again, the shootings in Chicago have caused more death and more pain. It's passed time for a well organized strategy by law enforcement, backed by the community, to stop these ongoing senseless murders in Chicago.",1158044984035225601,2019-08-04,16:00:14,repmaxinewaters,222,202,863
