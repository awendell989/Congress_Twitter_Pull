Mueller made clear Trump is NOT exonerated and that AG Barr is a liar.  Mueller did his job now it's time for Congress to do its job. No more hiding behind the special counsel. Enough is enough. It's time to #ImpeachTrump. We can't wait for 2020.  The time is NOW!,1133758735493545989,2019-05-29,15:35:21,repmaxinewaters,12434,25361,81112
"Low life Trump - lying, crooked, tax evader, porn star fornicator - should take his ridiculous self home, resign, and free us of what we will have to do to impeach him and throw him out of office!",1133523174623240193,2019-05-28,23:59:19,repmaxinewaters,31766,26989,101917
America's disgraceful president is totally out of control! He is now supporting murderous dictator Kim Jong Un who is testing ballistic missiles and threatening the United States. Does Trump's desire to be a dictator supercede the security of his own country?,1133522646400929792,2019-05-28,23:57:13,repmaxinewaters,3557,6383,24447
Trump is an embarrassing unAmerican traitor! How dare he denounce and belittle VP Biden on foreign soil on Memorial Day! How can these spineless Republicans look their spouses and children in the face and claim to teach them patriotism?,1133521653537923072,2019-05-28,23:53:16,repmaxinewaters,15761,13932,56236
"Today I spent time w/ vets in my district. Yes, I honored the fallen & condemned our leaders for turning a blind eye to homeless vets. Enough talk about how much we love our vets. Let’s get real.

"The only joking matter at @HUDgov is the current secretary. Instead of working on the numerous housing issues discussed this week, @SecretaryCarson spent his time trolling @FSCDems members & deflecting in order to hide his lack of knowledge about housing policy. #Resign",1132439366654201856,2019-05-26,00:12:39,repmaxinewaters,619,1749,5500
"At this week's @FSCDems hearing, @SecretaryCarson said his plan to triple rent for low-income households would protect the elderly & disabled but the @CenterOnBudget shows the elderly & disabled would see an avg monthly rent increase of $83 & $72 respectively.

"This week, the House passed my comprehensive bill to restore @CFPB to full strength.

US has a desperate homelessness problem. My bill is HR1856 the Ending Homelessness Act. Trump is attempting to force farmers hurt by his trade war to take a $16b subsidy. Farmers don't want a bailout - they want trade! Why does Trump ignore homelessness over an unwanted bailout?,1132339581867761664,2019-05-25,17:36:08,repmaxinewaters,2017,3675,11917

"Trump lackey Mick Mulvaney’s time at the top of the @CFPB had nothing to do with protecting consumers – but predatory companies had plenty to cheer for.

Today we celebrated the #19thAmendment. No one gave women anything. We fought for it. They’re still trying to suppress us. We’ll beat them again. pic.twitter.com/6RiW98lnLA,1131022389461114882,2019-05-22,02:22:05,repmaxinewaters,2717,8656,41762
