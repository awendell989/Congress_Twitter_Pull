"The demonstrations around the country today must not be ignored. Americans do not support the Impeached President’s needless escalation w/ Iran, nor do we want a senseless war. Peace advocates must not let up! Let’s keep showing our power & sending Trump a message: #NoWarWithIran",1215430810762915840,2020-01-10,00:31:01,repmaxinewaters,514,1266,4056
"Many are outraged that the impeached prez nearly caused a war w/ Iran & want Congress to intervene.

House Dems just passed a bill that limits any further military force against Iran by unhinged Trump w/out approval.

America needs a new president, not another war. #NoWarWithIran",1215429495722848258,2020-01-10,00:25:48,repmaxinewaters,3098,5504,24271
"No matter how much #MoscowMitch wants to dismiss articles or acquit Trump, so much info is revealed every day showing how the impeached president tried to get WH officials to break the law in his plot to extort Ukraine in exchange for an attack on Biden. Trump is guilty as hell.",1214356079116783618,2020-01-07,01:20:25,repmaxinewaters,1249,4979,17554
"Excellent new @FiveThirtyEight poll shows majority of Americans believe there is enough evidence to remove the impeached President from office. Joint GOP-Russian propaganda isn’t working. #MoscowMitch doesn’t want the truth to come out! What are you afraid of, Mitch?",1214297275457036289,2020-01-06,21:26:45,repmaxinewaters,474,2366,6648
"OK Repubs. Keep shielding & protecting this impeached prez despite his lies (15k); despite his unilaterally pulling out of Iran deal; despite weak answers on imminent danger; despite Mattis quitting, now Pentagon CoS quits; you are going to be responsible for dragging us to war!",1214267880159744000,2020-01-06,19:29:57,repmaxinewaters,393,981,3342
"Everyone knows the impeached President can’t be trusted. Is he lying about imminent danger? Did Trump make the decision on his own because he thinks he knows more than his generals? Why should we believe him when he, Pompeo, & Pence can’t keep their lies straight?",1214267656628588550,2020-01-06,19:29:03,repmaxinewaters,1117,5242,19271
"Only a reckless, cowardly, impeached international laughing stock would order a deadly drone strike from a golf resort  before running off to a rally to be worshipped by the few evangelicals who still support him. A real President would’ve immediately shared info w/ Congress.",1213564661548929033,2020-01-04,20:55:36,repmaxinewaters,18209,28432,110172
WAPO documented 15000+ lies told by Trump since he took office. How can the American people trust him when he lies all the time? He lied about Obama’s birth certificate and tweeted in 2011 that Obama would “start a war with Iran” to get reelected. Is that what Trump is doing now?,1213564476735266816,2020-01-04,20:54:52,repmaxinewaters,1170,3757,11961

"This prez walked away from the Iran Nuclear Deal for peace, threatened the ""end of Iran,"" killed top Iranian general w/out AUMF from Congress & abandoned our Kurdish allies fighting ISIS. Americans deserve better answers rather than dangerous disruption in the entire Middle East!",1213147479572660225,2020-01-03,17:17:52,repmaxinewaters,1997,6635,22522
