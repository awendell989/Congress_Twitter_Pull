"Trump, you better know you cannot declare war w/o Congress giving you the authorization for use of military force.  You better not try it.",1142917915534155793,2019-06-23,22:10:40,repmaxinewaters,10077,4849,21271
"Trump, is your confrontation w/ Iran a diversionary tactic? Do you believe getting the US worrying about a war w/ Iran will overshadow growing calls for an impeachment inquiry? Trump, you are a dangerous, narcissistic, poor excuse for a leader. You deserve to be impeached.",1142917853911420933,2019-06-23,22:10:25,repmaxinewaters,11638,12361,48526
"Trump, so you are placing more sanctions on Iran. You are trying to further provoke Iran so you can strike. You're alienating the other countries who were a part of the JCPOA. How can you expect our allies to join w/ us in a war with Iran?",1142917196387143680,2019-06-23,22:07:48,repmaxinewaters,856,905,2818
"Trump, we know you are angling for war with Iran. Stop it now. Iran was in compliance with the JCPOA. You and Netanyahu had better not try to take us to war. We don't need it & Israel doesn't need it.",1142914912840290306,2019-06-23,21:58:44,repmaxinewaters,1415,1498,4670
"Trump, you started this confrontation w/ Iran. Why did you unilaterally renege on the JCPOA agreement of the US and six other countries to avoid Iran's nuclear buildup?",1142914560279666688,2019-06-23,21:57:20,repmaxinewaters,368,596,1825
"Trump, you get no credit for so-called stopping the strike against Iran. Why was the unmanned drone in Iran's airspace? Why the surveillance? Don't provoke and then pretend innocence.",1142914280075010049,2019-06-23,21:56:13,repmaxinewaters,20680,6865,29341
"#nomorewars This president is up to his old tricks allowing Bolton and Pompeo to be the war hawks while he pretends to be reasonable so when he strikes Iran he can say ""I tried not to strike."" Real trying is diplomacy. Back off 45!",1142912860563169282,2019-06-23,21:50:34,repmaxinewaters,658,1127,3294
"This weekend I joined Dems to fight back against the GOP & Trump’s attacks on the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act.

"Sarah Huckabee Sanders on her way out. Kellyanne Conway being pushed out. All we need now is for Trump to follow his ""alternative facts"" spokesperson & his LYING press secretary. Good riddance to them all!",1139715198510669825,2019-06-15,02:04:12,repmaxinewaters,7215,7129,36413
"No one should be shocked at Trump admitting it's ok for Russia to interfere in our elections. Trump has colluded w/ the Russians for years & YES they helped him get elected. I told you so.  I insist Trump must be impeached. Finally, more Dems calling for an impeachment inquiry.",1139714632854061056,2019-06-15,02:01:58,repmaxinewaters,8243,13909,53565

"If Trump's tariffs ever became real, it would hurt millennials who are already working hard for higher pay to purchase cars, groceries, invest in their own business, or pay down student loans. Most people aren't born w/ a silver spoon & a million dollar loan from dad. Back off 45",1137059590795931653,2019-06-07,18:11:46,repmaxinewaters,2964,1998,7040
"Spineless GOP Senators grew a backbone this week & finally stood up to their Dictator Trump on something: Mexico tariffs, also known as a TAX INCREASE on American consumers. Bet your bottom dollar, Trump will back off by the weekend. Just another bluff!",1137059255968817152,2019-06-07,18:10:26,repmaxinewaters,14341,9389,40628
