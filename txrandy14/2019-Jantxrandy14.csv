Trump is doing what the Constitution requires him to do as 1 of his primary responsibilities: keep Americans safe. He has offered help on DACA front for 3 years. Yet D’s refuse. How many more Americans must die at hands of illegal/criminals before D’s care? #DemsWakeUp,1087068564257996800,2019-01-20,19:25:17,txrandy14,57,1,21

"ICYMI: Last week, I wrote an op-ed directed at OMB & HUD. Nearly a year ago, Congress appropriated a 3rd portion of disaster funds. Today, we’re still waiting to see them, thanks to the Administrative State & Big Government Bureaucracy.

"Why do D's want to ""fund"" the govt only until Feb 08? To get past President's State of Union where he will expose their weakness on Natl Security at our border & their unwillingness to care about Law Abiding Americans more than they do about illegals & terrorists. Sad, huh?...rw",1082659972624932864,2019-01-08,15:27:06,txrandy14,16,6,11
