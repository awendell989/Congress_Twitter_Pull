Funny & sad. Pelosi says the border bill should be about the children. Would that the D’s were as concerned about the unborn. Lowey just said: “We will never stop fighting for the children whi are our future.” I wonder why that doesn’t apply to unborn Americans? @realDonaldTrump,1144348447937613825,2019-06-27,20:55:05,txrandy14,13,8,33
