It was an honor to join @IvankaTrump at the White House today to kick-off the #WGDP initiative to invest in and empower women across the globe. Women & girls are the backbone of our societies but are still denied opportunities- this will help change that. https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1093490214021066752 …,1093630972363448322,2019-02-07,22:01:57,senatorrisch,23,7,39
