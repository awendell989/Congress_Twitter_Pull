"House Democrats have been conducting an impeachment inquiry without due process, fairness or transparency for over a month. No American should be subjected to this kind of unfairness. Today’s vote is nothing more than a Halloween trick to try to give this sham some credibility.",1189931037754822661,2019-10-31,15:44:01,repkenbuck,142,67,196

Impeachment should be based on a fair process. The @HouseDemocrats' lack of transparency throughout this process robs the American people of the chance to evaluate the credibility of each witness and the inquiry itself.

House Dems are conducting an impeachment inquiry in the basement of the Capitol behind closed doors & denying the GOP access to basic docs.
