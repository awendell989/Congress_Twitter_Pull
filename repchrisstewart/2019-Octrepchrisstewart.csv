"Last night’s successful raid that killed Al Baghdadi sends a message to terrorists throughout the world—the United States will hunt you down & bring you to justice.

"Any American President, Republican or Democrat, is elected by the people. Those who work for the administration have a duty to enact the policy of the executive branch. By undermining the President's agenda, they are ultimately betraying American voters. https://www.deseret.com/utah/2019/10/22/20927126/fed-workers-who-undermine-president-betraying-americans-stewart-says …",1186765461226217472,2019-10-22,22:05:09,repchrisstewart,205,33,77

I am sad to hear of the passing of my colleague Rep. Elijah Cummings. I send my warmest condolences to his family and friends during this tough time. He lived a life dedicated to public service and his legacy will not be forgotten.,1184825821200035841,2019-10-17,13:37:43,repchrisstewart,19,5,44

President Trump must not make the same mistakes President Obama did. I will continue to press the White House to protect our Kurdish allies & security interests in the region.,1181325977911283713,2019-10-07,21:50:35,repchrisstewart,79,16,84

Just signed @RepAndyBiggsAZ resolution to condemn and censure Chairman Schiff. His actions misled the American people and have made a mockery of the impeachment process. https://twitter.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1179420705030627328 …,1180120903352537088,2019-10-04,14:02:03,repchrisstewart,320,174,439
Adam Schiff has an enormous credibility problem and his recent actions make it even more evident. He clearly knew the essence of the whistleblower complaint and he wasn't honest.
