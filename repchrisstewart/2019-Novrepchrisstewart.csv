"This week I signed on to The Ghost Army Congressional Gold Medal Act. This legislation honors a top-secret unit that used inflatable tanks & sound effects to deceive the Germans in WWII. Due to the secrecy of the operation, these American heroes were never recognized.",1197947343515066368,2019-11-22,18:37:58,repchrisstewart,73,46,215
"Continuing Resolutions are an irresponsible way to fund our government and military. Today's CR was no exception. Not only does it lack funds to secure our border, it does not give our troops the pay raise they deserve.

"Lt. Col. Vindman characterized the 7/25 phone call as a “demand” based on his military experience & military culture. 

President Trump & President Zelensky—who have never served in the military—did not interpret it as a demand.  

Anyone else's interpretation is irrelevant. pic.twitter.com/ra1SlGSiOb",1196854262753628162,2019-11-19,18:14:27,repchrisstewart,1686,871,2143

"Can you give me an example, anytime, where the Vice President shows up and demands that a specific prosecutor be fired & gives them a 6 hour time limit to do so? Are you aware of that ever happening in any other place?

This morning I sent a letter to Chairman Schiff requesting a correction to accurately reflect my attendance at two  depositions. I have reviewed every transcript with counsel & other committee members. To suggest that I am unfamiliar with the testimony of any witness is absurd. pic.twitter.com/mD1hyD1FqM,1194394394826354688,2019-11-12,23:19:49,repchrisstewart,92,62,146

#ICYMI: I joined Chris Wallace on @FoxNews to discuss the vote on the House impeachment resolution. This resolution doesn't follow the precedent of past impeachment proceedings & solidifies Democrats' control over the process.
