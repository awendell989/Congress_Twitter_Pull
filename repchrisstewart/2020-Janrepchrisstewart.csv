Utahns deserve better from the Endangered Species Act than we’re getting. Critical infrastructure projects are too slow & too expensive because of requirements that aren’t even resulting in species recovery. This bill helps alleviate some of that burden on our infrastructure. https://twitter.com/westerncaucus/status/1217576365949628421 …,1217877441093472256,2020-01-16,18:33:03,repchrisstewart,27,9,32

Suicide hits close to home with Utah having the 5th highest suicide rate in the nation. I’ve met with family and friends of those who have taken their own life. I’ve heard their stories and I’m responding to their pleas for help.,1217566685617704960,2020-01-15,21:58:13,repchrisstewart,12,7,56

"My good friend @HurdOnTheHill does a great job explaining the situation in Iran.

I know most of the key members of our national security team personally. They are among the finest and most competent leaders I've ever worked with.

@POTUS's call for a new deal with Iran should give the entire world hope for a better and more peaceful future. Any new deal negotiated by the President and his team must guarantee Iran won't have a nuclear weapon & will end Iran's support of terrorism worldwide.,1214975366487523329,2020-01-08,18:21:15,repchrisstewart,17,13,68
We must learn more details before we can evaluate the seriousness of the attack and what the appropriate response should be. It's possible to have peace with the people of Iran and still protect American lives and interests in the region. That is our goal.,1214720703200727041,2020-01-08,01:29:18,repchrisstewart,27,10,108
