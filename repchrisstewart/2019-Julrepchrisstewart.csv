Introduced the Smoke-Free Schools Act with @RepEliotEngel @HaleyLive. E-cigarettes have made their way into schools across the country & have quickly become an epidemic among youth. E-cigarettes need to be taken as serious as combustible cigarettes & this bill is a great start.,1154809890700955649,2019-07-26,17:45:07,repchrisstewart,9,5,12

"The irony of this bill? It hurts the very people it’s claiming to help.
