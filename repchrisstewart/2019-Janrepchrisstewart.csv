The President put forward a very reasonable proposal that would secure our border and provide relief for our Dreamers. He has tried to compromise with the Dems but they rejected his offer before they even heard it. Itâ€™s time they came to the table and negotiated in good faith.,1086777893143883782,2019-01-20,00:10:15,repchrisstewart,182,15,92

Today I voted to reinstate sanctions on certain Russian companies. I am not convinced that they have met the necessary requirements. I disagree with the President. The sanctions must remain in place.,1085985116541931523,2019-01-17,19:40:03,repchrisstewart,57,97,516

President Trump made a compelling case tonight. The two Democrat leaders (like many other Dems) voted in the past for physical barriers and border security under previous presidents.
