"Today’s GAO legal opinion is the last and most authoritative word on Trump’s hold on funds appropriated for Ukraine: Definitively refutes Trump’s “did nothing wrong” mantra, instead finding Trump violated the law. Decisive evidence today for impeachment.",1217899146880876548,2020-01-16,19:59:18,eleanornorton,0,5,20
"Republican Senators have begun pressuring Mitch McConnell for a fair trial. By all accounts, Speaker Pelosi’s tactic of delaying sending the Articles of Impeachment has paid off. pic.twitter.com/Jq5BemF5EW",1217125368504688642,2020-01-14,16:44:35,eleanornorton,0,7,37

"Democrats have gained from the delay in sending Articles of Impeachment to the Senate – some Republican Senators are pushing for a fairer process with witnesses, Speaker Pelosi’s bottom line.",1216849975252062208,2020-01-13,22:30:16,eleanornorton,2,6,38
"I spoke on the House floor on the War Powers Resolution as a limit on potential military conflict with Iran without consultation with Congress, as required. The Constitution gives Congress the explicit power to declare war, not the president. pic.twitter.com/elJw9oRHQI",1215715087459266560,2020-01-10,19:20:38,eleanornorton,3,17,30

It took the conservative Supreme Court to stop Republicans from engineering a census undercount. The Constitution requires counting all persons – critical for Republican & Democratic districts alike to get the full funding due to them based on population. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go-HDt6Z3XE …,1215376199347843072,2020-01-09,20:54:01,eleanornorton,1,6,21
"Today, Trump security officials flunked their own briefing on why Soleimani was killed. No precipitating act by Iran, no info on how US is safer, and nothing new on planned attacks by Iran. https://norton.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/norton-cites-major-deficiencies-in-trump-administration-briefing-on …",1215046891760771084,2020-01-08,23:05:28,eleanornorton,2,9,37
"The House cannot sit still and allow President Trump to become an imperial president, answerable to no one. Tit-for-tat with Iran is not a policy. It is a childish and dangerous response. pic.twitter.com/Kpjk4mErvE",1214997882098593795,2020-01-08,19:50:43,eleanornorton,1,13,45

"Seeing in real time tit-for-tat that could lead to war: attack kills US contractor in Iraq, US air strikes on Iraq and Syria, US embassy attacked, Trump orders killing of top Iranian General Soleimani.",1214249546974453760,2020-01-06,18:17:06,eleanornorton,4,2,5
