"We are celebrating 100 years of the right to vote for (only some!) women. For ALL the residents of DC, there is no right to a final vote in the House and no vote at all in the Senate. Our #DCstatehood hearing is Sept 19th. Passage of HR 51 coming this Congress!",1167182496821338112,2019-08-29,21:09:27,eleanornorton,3,16,58
"The G7 was forced to a do-nothing one-page statement. The presence of Trump on the world stage is keeping urgent issues – from climate change, to North Korea’s restart of missile testing – from being seriously addressed. The US neither leads nor follows, it obstructs.",1166450817693626369,2019-08-27,20:42:01,eleanornorton,3,8,22
"Trump’s tariff threat produced quick retaliation, not intimidation, by the Chinese government. Unlike the USA, a totalitarian regime does not need to respond to public opinion. As tariffs kick in, Trump will see that he does.",1166443227777572864,2019-08-27,20:11:51,eleanornorton,1,6,15
"Mark your calendars! One month from today, on Thursday, September 19th, the House will hold the first hearing on #DCstatehood in over 25 years. Our bill (HR 51) has 215 voting cosponsors. Looking for more because it will almost surely pass the House this Congress!",1163461561979219972,2019-08-19,14:43:47,eleanornorton,6,32,89
"There is still time to cosponsor HR 51 to make DC the 51st state. Our thanks to Democrats who have already cosponsored. For those who have not, there is still time to cosponsor HR 51, which will almost surely pass the House this session. #DCstatehood",1162081308048318465,2019-08-15,19:19:08,eleanornorton,2,14,73

"The good news for DC is that since Democrats took control of the House, I have not had to fight to protect DC’s gun violence prevention laws from Republican attacks. DC should remain free to determine its own laws. #HandsOffDC",1161352688422010880,2019-08-13,19:03:52,eleanornorton,3,4,24
"House Democrats gave gun violence prevention and background checks such high priority, our bill was “HR 8.”  The least the Senate should do, following the tragic massacres in El Paso and Dayton, is come back into session and pass HR 8.",1161352534897954821,2019-08-13,19:03:15,eleanornorton,2,8,20

The new Dem House gave priority to passing a bill requiring a check on background before selling a gun. Why isn’t that the headline after El Paso and Dayton?#Senatepassbackgroundcheck.,1158074410844270592,2019-08-04,17:57:10,eleanornorton,4,16,40
