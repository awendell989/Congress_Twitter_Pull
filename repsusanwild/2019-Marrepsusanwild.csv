"MYTH about #RaisetheWage Act:

-Raising the min. wage will lead to job losses

FACT:
In states with higher min. wage there has been very little to no job loss

üì¢BECAUSE

When workers have more money in their pockets, they spend it

üì¢AND

More spending = More jobs pic.twitter.com/3103Uvb3DW",1103339132489793536,2019-03-06,16:58:42,repsusanwild,16,84,149
