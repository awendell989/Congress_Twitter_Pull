From affordability to accountability to access to campus safety and civil rights, we must tackle the big issues in higher education and ring in the voices of students. #MurrayHEA #HigherEd pic.twitter.com/AHVmYHZ3fb",1101540427637895170,2019-03-01,17:51:18,pattymurray,13,13,39
The House voted on Tuesday to overturn President Trump’s declaration of #FakeTrumpEmergency and I hope we do the same in the Senate.

Today I spoke at @amprog about #HigherEd & the impact that reauthorizing the Higher Education Act in the right way can have on our students. Our #HigherEd system reinforces inequity & federal investments can either close or widen those divides.
