"Keeping drinking water safe is a key infrastructure challenge.

Unfortunately, Trump's #DirtyWaterRule would cancel Clean Water Act protections for streams that feed drinking water sources for tens of millions.

"No surprise that former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler is downplaying the threat of climate change.

Thousands have already lost their insurance thanks to the Trump Administration’s sabotage of the health care system.

"Trump is lying about Puerto Rico, which hasn’t gotten anywhere near $91 billion.

Trump cruelly ignored and even held back disaster assistance to Americans in Puerto Rico as thousands died.
