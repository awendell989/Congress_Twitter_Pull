Were you lying then or are you lying now? Either way the American people do not want to go to war and you should stop sabotaging diplomatic efforts. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1146268912553775110 …",1146433249926889473,2019-07-03,14:59:21,repdonbeyer,11,38,76
"Exactly right. Trump is taking money from parks across the country to pay for his July Fourth political event on the Mall. People visiting parks in Montana, Tennessee, Utah, or Alaska et. al. will lose so Trump can have a spectacle.

"Forcing the people’s elected representatives to sue to enforce a clear legal statute is a new low in presidential corruption. The President's refusal to follow norms of transparency strongly suggests he has something to hide.

President Trump’s effort to make the annual Independence Day celebration in the National Capital Region about himself is appalling. The added news that the @GOP is distributing tickets creates significant concerns about the illegal use of public resources. https://twitter.com/svdate/status/1145816836480667648 …,1146090153825505285,2019-07-02,16:16:00,repdonbeyer,8,92,264

I have been pressing for answers about the process by which Ivanka Trump obtained a security clearance for two years now. The few responses which she and the White House have given mostly turned out to be lies. https://twitter.com/RepDonBeyer/status/1103102813360586752 …,1145724629098598401,2019-07-01,16:03:32,repdonbeyer,51,499,889
