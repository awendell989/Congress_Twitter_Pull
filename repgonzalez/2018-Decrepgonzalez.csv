We must be diplomatic and strategic in securing our borders. We must be diligent in protecting trade relations with our neighbors. And @realDonaldTrump must exercise the decorum expected from the White House - even from his Twitter account.,1078740746008702976,2018-12-28,19:53:30,repgonzalez,2,4,19
"The American people need to understand that closing the SW border would have terrible implications for American consumers and businesses. If I recall correctly, the biggest threats faced at the US-MX Border this year have been the inhumane policies enacted by the Administration.",1078740744943427586,2018-12-28,19:53:30,repgonzalez,2,10,28
"It is increasingly worrisome that @realDonaldTrump is not kept accountable for his rhetoric - be it online or on any platform. No, Mr. President, you cannot shut down the Southwest Border as a bargaining chip for your useless border wall proposal. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1078625779670503426 …",1078740743735443456,2018-12-28,19:53:29,repgonzalez,5,20,55
"I have faith in democracy and @senchuckschumer. I ask that he continue standing in solidarity with America - no taxpayer money for a border wall. @realDonaldTrump can spin this any way he wants, but he cannot spin the truth and ineffectiveness of this approach. #TrumpShutdown",1076235138567159808,2018-12-21,21:57:07,repgonzalez,8,8,25

Oh right - they're not.

".@realDonaldTrump school of thought:

- Shut down @DHSgov to secure the border? Ironic.

- Pass protection for the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge, then cut that measure.

If I am correct, the last Trump school was a fraudulent scheme. Why are we to buy into anything he proposes? pic.twitter.com/41Qbc2vL1m",1075906680305737728,2018-12-21,00:11:56,repgonzalez,5,4,8

"Next Congress, I look forward to increased support for the Repatriate Our Patriots Act. This bill helps create a pathway to citizenship for deported vets that held a clean record prior to service.

I will agree with the wall the day I see a wire transfer in the amount of $25B from the MX Govt to the US Treasury designated for wall funding that @realDonaldTrump promised during his campaign. Americans should not be responsible for monumental squandering of taxpayer dollars.,1072571297643810817,2018-12-11,19:18:19,repgonzalez,20,23,53
"Army Veteran, Carlos Torres, served this country, and in return, this country failed him. He fought for a home that turned him away, and in the end, he never saw that home again.

.@CMSGov has included a proposed rule that lowers prescription drug costs & increases transparency around Medicare Parts C/D. I cosponsored the PHAIR Pricing Act to lower drug costs to Medicare recipients at the point of sale.
