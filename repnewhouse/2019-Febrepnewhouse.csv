This so-called “deal” calls for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero in only 10 years—one independent estimate led by a team of Stanford engineers suggests it would cost our nation at least $7 trillion to convert all of America’s power to renewable power. pic.twitter.com/hqGwX5g8n7,1100199038085971968,2019-02-26,01:01:06,repnewhouse,4,2,9

This is a debate that goes beyond partisan politics.

It doesn’t matter how they have entered this world; providing medical care for babies who have just been born is a human rights issue. The recent remarks made by the governor of Virginia show the need to take a stand against infanticide. 1/3 https://twitter.com/leonardkl/status/1092576570823372801 …,1092598370152128515,2019-02-05,01:38:45,repnewhouse,3,5,14
