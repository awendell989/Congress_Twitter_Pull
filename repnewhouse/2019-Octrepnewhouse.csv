It is an honor to welcome @SecretaryPerry and @repgregwalden to Hanford and #WA04. It's a great day for the @HanfordSite as we celebrate the completion of sludge removal from the K-Basins! https://twitter.com/MeganMagensky/status/1179073481691938817¬†‚Ä¶,1179098966937493505,2019-10-01,18:21:14,repnewhouse,8,2,14
