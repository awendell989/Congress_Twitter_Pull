@HouseIntel deemed Huawei a national security threat in 2012. Why should countries continue to engage with a company that is untrustworthy and threatens international security? I commend @SecPompeo for continuing to educate our partners about the risks of engaging with Huawei https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1134473641100554240 …,1134514648823320576,2019-05-31,17:39:05,reptedyoho,0,0,0

I commend General Dunford for bringing attention to Xi Jinping’s deliberate dishonesty regarding the South China Sea. China continually makes unjustifiable claims and upsets regional stability in order to assert themselves on the world stage. This aggression must not be tolerated https://twitter.com/ChannelNewsAsia/status/1133821588237721600 …,1134189417428639751,2019-05-30,20:06:43,reptedyoho,4,2,12
