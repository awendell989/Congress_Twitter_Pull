He wasn't even sworn in yet & there was nothing to impeach him for, but facts be damned, the resistance has always wanted him out from the get go.",1134783596416380928,2019-06-01,11:27:47,repleezeldin,91,146,411
I remember how big of a deal Dems & the media made in 2016 asking over & over again whether President Trump & Republicans would accept the outcome of the 2016 election. It all makes sense now why. They weren't going to accept the results if/when it ended up the other way around.,1134783595615272960,2019-06-01,11:27:47,repleezeldin,72,111,335
"Regarding the unvetted, unverified dossier used to collect the FISA warrant, ironically enough, the Clinton campaign & DNC paid a foreign former spy to collect the dossier's salacious & fatally flawed info from foreign sources.",1134783594759643136,2019-06-01,11:27:46,repleezeldin,113,87,310
"Dems & former DOJ/FBI officials who were in certain top roles fall of 2016 still have ZERO interest in talking about & acknowledging misconduct & mischief at top of DOJ/FBI, including deeply troubling, clear as day abuse of FISA process to secure a spying warrant on a US citizen.",1134783593870483456,2019-06-01,11:27:46,repleezeldin,79,99,317
"There was obvious misconduct by Obama admin officials with regards to how the Clinton email probe ended, the Trump-Russia probe began, etc. The justice system should never be weaponized like this ever again. Glad much of this info is getting declassified for the public.",1134783592993873920,2019-06-01,11:27:46,repleezeldin,232,127,399
Russia meddling is a problem. The GOP has been raising red flags about it a long time before the Dems woke up to it. The leap though that somehow Pres Trump colluded w/ the Russians & that he should be removed from office for it was a massive leap right off the credibility cliff.,1134783592083668997,2019-06-01,11:27:46,repleezeldin,879,635,2093
