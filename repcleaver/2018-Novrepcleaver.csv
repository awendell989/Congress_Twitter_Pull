Congratulations to Kansas City's Chris Stout on being nominated for @CNN's Top 10 Heroes of 2018! I've seen firsthand the great work @VCP_HQ is doing for veterans in our community and I couldn't be more thankful for his efforts. https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/18/us/cnnheroes-chris-stout-veterans-community-project/index.html …,1058027507168018432,2018-11-01,16:06:29,repcleaver,1,14,42
