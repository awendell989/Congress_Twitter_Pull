"My view is that a child care center, any provider that’s caring for the children of veterans should not be employing an individual that’s been charged with a sex crime, a violent crime.

We need to focus on maximum wages not minimum wages.  I want workers to earn a lot more than $15 per hour.  But to give that opportunity to as many workers as possible we need economic growth—not central planning from Washington.,1151976481175822339,2019-07-18,22:06:10,repandybarr,10,21,29
"And less than 20 percent of workers who would see a wage increase under this bill actually live in households that earn less than the federal poverty line.
